<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This volume has been written to enable those who
have a taste for the furniture of a bygone day to
arrive at some conclusion as to the essential points of
the various styles made in England.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to give some lucid
historical account of the progress and development
in the art of making domestic furniture, with especial
reference to its evolution in this country.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as many of the finest specimens of old
English woodwork and furniture have left the country
of their origin and crossed the Atlantic, it is time
that the public should awaken to the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
heritages of their forefathers are objects of envy to
all lovers of art. It is a painful reflection to know
that the temptation of money will shortly denude the
old farmhouses and manor houses of England of
their unappreciated treasures. Before the hand of
the despoiler shall have snatched everything within
reach, it is the hope of the writer that this little
volume may not fall on stony ground, and that the
possessors of fine old English furniture may realise
their responsibilities.</p>

<p>It has been thought advisable to touch upon
French furniture as exemplified in the national
collections of such importance as the Jones Bequest
at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Wallace
Collection, to show the influence of foreign art upon
our own designers. Similarly, Italian, Spanish, and
Dutch furniture, of which many remarkable examples
are in private collections in this country,
has been dealt with in passing, to enable the
reader to estimate the relation of English art to
contemporary foreign schools of decoration and
design.</p>

<p>The authorities of the Victoria and Albert Museum
have willingly extended their assistance in regard to
photographs, and by the special permission of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
Board of Education the frontispiece and other representative
examples in the national collection appear
as illustrations to this volume.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge generous assistance and
courteous permission from owners of fine specimens
in allowing me facilities for reproducing illustrations
of them in this volume.</p>

<p>I am especially indebted to the Right Honourable
Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, G.C.B., I.S.O., and to
the Rev. Canon Haig Brown, Master of the
Charterhouse, for the inclusion of illustrations of
furniture of exceptional interest.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the <i>Connoisseur</i> have generously
furnished me with lists of prices obtained at auction
from their useful monthly publication, <i>Auction Sale
Prices</i>, and have allowed the reproduction of illustrations
which have appeared in the pages of the
<i>Connoisseur</i>.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Messrs. Hampton, of Pall
Mall, for their kind permission to include as illustrations
several fine pieces from their collection of
antique furniture. I am under a similar obligation
to Messrs. Waring, who have kindly allowed me to
select some of their typical examples.</p>

<p>To my other friends, without whose kind advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
and valuable aid this volume could never have
appeared, I tender a grateful and appreciative
acknowledgment of my indebtedness.</p>

<h2><a name="GLOSSARY_OF_TERMS_USED" id="GLOSSARY_OF_TERMS_USED"></a>GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Armoire.</i>&mdash;A large cupboard of French design of the
dimensions of the modern wardrobe. In the
days of Louis XIV. these pieces were made in
magnificent style. The Jones Collection at the
Victoria and Albert Museum has several fine
examples. (See illustration, p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Baroque.</i>&mdash;Used in connection with over ornate and
incongruous decoration as in <i>rococo</i> style.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Bombé.</i>&mdash;A term applied to pieces of furniture which
swell out at the sides.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Boule.</i>&mdash;A special form of marquetry of brass and
tortoiseshell perfected by André Charles Boule
in the reign of Louis XIV. (See <a href="#VI">Chapter VI.</a>,
where specimens of this kind of work are
illustrated.) The name has been corrupted into
a trade term <i>Buhl</i>, to denote this style of
marquetry. Boule or <i>Première partie</i> is a metal
inlay, usually brass, applied to a tortoiseshell
background. See also <i><a href="#Counter-Boule">Counter-boule</a></i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Bureau.</i>&mdash;A cabinet with drawers, and having a drop-down
front for use as a writing-table. Bureaux
are of many forms. (See illustration, p. <a href="#Page_231">231</a>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Cabriole.</i>&mdash;Used in connection with the legs of tables
and chairs which are curved in form, having a
sudden arch outwards from the seat. (See
illustration, p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Caryatides.</i>&mdash;Carved female figures applied to columns
in Greek architecture, as at the Erectheum at
Athens. They were employed by woodcarvers,
and largely introduced into Renaissance furniture
of an architectural character. Elizabethan
craftsmen were especially fond of their use as
terminals, and in the florid decoration of elaborate
furniture.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Cassone.</i>&mdash;An Italian marriage coffer. In <a href="#I">Chapter I.</a>
will be found a full description of these <i>cassoni</i>.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Commode.</i>&mdash;A chest of drawers of French style. In
the chapters dealing with the styles of Louis
XIV., Louis XV., and Louis XVI., these are
fully described and illustrations are given.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i><a name="Counter-Boule" id="Counter-Boule"></a>Counter-Boule.</i> <i>Contre partie.</i>&mdash;See <a href="#VI">Chapter VI.</a>,
where specimens of this work are illustrated. It
consists of a brass groundwork with tortoiseshell
inlay.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>French Polish.</i>&mdash;A cheap and nasty method used
since 1851 to varnish poor-looking wood to
disguise its inferiority. It is quicker than the
old method of rubbing in oil and turpentine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
beeswax. It is composed of shellac dissolved
in methylated spirits with colouring matter
added.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Gate-leg table.</i>&mdash;This term is self-explanatory. The
legs of this class of table open like a gate. They
belong to Jacobean days, and are sometimes
spoken of as Cromwellian tables. An illustration
of one appears on the cover.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Gothic.</i>&mdash;This term was originally applied to the
mediæval styles of architecture. It was used as
a term of reproach and contempt at a time when
it was the fashion to write Latin and to expect
it to become the universal language. In woodcarving
the Gothic style followed the architecture.
A fine example of the transition between
Gothic and the oncoming Renaissance is given
(p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Inlay.</i>&mdash;A term used for the practice of decorating
surfaces and panels of furniture with wood of
various colours, mother-of-pearl, or ivory. The
inlay is let into the wood of which the piece
inlaid is composed.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Jacobean.</i>&mdash;Strictly speaking, only furniture of the
days of James I. should be termed Jacobean.
But by some collectors the period is held to
extend to James II.&mdash;that is from 1603 to 1688.
Other collectors prefer the term Carolean for a
portion of the above period, which is equally
misleading. Jacobean is only a rough generalisation
of seventeenth-century furniture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Lacquer.</i> <i>Lac.</i>&mdash;A transparent varnish used in its
perfection by the Chinese and Japanese. (See
"Consular Report on Japanese Lacquered Work,"
in <a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">Bibliography</a>.) Introduced into Holland
and France, it was imitated with great success.
Under Louis XV. Vernis-Martin became the
rage (<a href="#Vernis-Martin"><i>q.v.</i></a>).</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Linen Pattern.</i>&mdash;A form of carving panels to represent
a folded napkin. This particular design was
largely used in France and Germany prior to its
adoption here. (See illustration, p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Marquetry.</i>&mdash;Inlays of coloured woods, arranged with
some design, geometric, floral, or otherwise, are
classed under this style. (See also <i><a href="#Parquetry">Parquetry</a></i>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i><a name="Mortise" id="Mortise"></a>Mortise.</i>&mdash;A term in carpentry used to denote the
hole made in a piece of wood to receive the end
of another piece to be joined to it. The portion
which fits into the mortise is called the tenon.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Oil Polish.</i>&mdash;Old furniture, before the introduction of
varnishes and French polish and other inartistic
effects, was polished by rubbing the surface with
a stone, if it was a large area as in the case of a
table, and then applying linseed oil and polishing
with beeswax and turpentine. The fine tone
after centuries of this treatment is evident in old
pieces which have a metallic lustre that cannot
be imitated.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i><a name="Parquetry" id="Parquetry"></a>Parquetry.</i>&mdash;Inlays of woods of the same colour are
termed parquetry work in contradistinction to
marquetry, which is in different colour. Geometric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
designs are mainly used as in parquetry
floors.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Reeded.</i>&mdash;This term is applied to the style of decoration
by which thin narrow strips of wood are
placed side by side on the surface of furniture.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Renaissance.</i>&mdash;The style which was originated in Italy
in the fifteenth century, supplanting the Mediæval
styles which embraced Byzantine and Gothic
art; the new-birth was in origin a literary movement,
but quickly affected art, and grew with
surprising rapidity, and affected every country in
Europe. It is based on Classic types, and its
influence on furniture and woodwork followed its
adoption in architecture.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Restored.</i>&mdash;This word is the fly in the pot of ointment
to all who possess antiquarian tastes. It ought
to mean, in furniture, that only the most necessary
repairs have been made in order to preserve
the object. It more often means that a considerable
amount of misapplied ingenuity has
gone to the remaking of a badly-preserved
specimen. Restorations are only permissible
at the hands of most conscientious craftsmen.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Rococo.</i>&mdash;A style which was most markedly offensive
in the time of Louis XV. Meaningless elaborations
of scroll and shell work, with rocky backgrounds
and incongruous ornamentations, are its
chief features. <i>Baroque</i> is another term applied
to this overloaded style.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Settee.</i>&mdash;An upholstered form of the settle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Settle.</i>&mdash;A wooden seat with back and arms, capable
of seating three or four persons side by side.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Splat.</i>&mdash;The wooden portion in the back of a chair
connecting the top rail with the seat.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Strapwork.</i>&mdash;This is applied to the form of decoration
employed by the Elizabethan woodcarvers in
imitation of Flemish originals. (See p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Stretcher.</i>&mdash;The rail which connects the legs of a
chair or a table with one another. In earlier
forms it was used as a footrest to keep the feet
from the damp or draughty rush floor.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Tenon.</i>&mdash;"Mortise and Tenon joint." (See <i><a href="#Mortise">Mortise</a></i>.)</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Turned Work.</i>&mdash;The spiral rails and uprights of
chairs were turned with the lathe in Jacobean
days. Prior to the introduction of the lathe all
work was carved without the use of this tool.
Pieces of furniture have been found where the
maker has carved the turned work in all its
details of form, either from caprice or from
ignorance of the existence of the quicker method.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i>Veneer.</i>&mdash;A method of using thin layers of wood and
laying them on a piece of furniture, either as
marquetry in different colours, or in one wood
only. It was an invention in order to employ
finer specimens of wood carefully selected in the
parts of a piece of furniture most noticeable. It
has been since used to hide inferior wood.</p>

<p style="text-indent: -2em;"><i><a name="Vernis-Martin" id="Vernis-Martin"></a>Vernis-Martin</i> (Martin's Varnish).&mdash;The lacquered
work of a French carriage-painter named Martin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
who claimed to have discovered the secret of the
Japanese lac, and who, in 1774, was granted a
monopoly for its use. He applied it successfully
to all kinds of furniture, and to fan-guards and
sticks. In the days of Madame du Pompadour
Vernis-Martin had a great vogue, and panels
prepared by Martin were elaborately painted
upon by Lancret and Boucher. To this day
his varnish retains its lustre undimmed, and
specimens command high prices.</p></div>

<p>In attempting to deal with the subject of old
furniture in a manner not too technical, certain
broad divisions have to be made for convenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
in classification. The general reader does not want
information concerning the iron bed of Og, King
of Bashan, nor of Cicero's table of citrus-wood,
which cost £9,000; nor are details of the chair of
Dagobert and of the jewel-chest of Richard of
Cornwall of much worth to the modern collector.</p>

<p>It will be found convenient to eliminate much
extraneous matter, such as the early origins of
furniture and its development in the Middle
Ages, and to commence in this country with the
Tudor period. Broadly speaking, English furniture
falls under three heads&mdash;the Oak Period, embracing
the furniture of the sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries; the Walnut Period, including the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; the
Mahogany Period, beginning with the reign of
George III. It may be observed that the names of
kings and of queens have been applied to various
styles of furniture as belonging to their reign. Early
Victorian is certainly a more expressive term than
early nineteenth century. Cromwellian tables, Queen
Anne chairs, or Louis Seize commodes all have an
especial meaning as referring to styles more or less
prevalent when those personages lived. As there is
no record of the makers of most of the old English
furniture, and as a piece of furniture cannot be judged
as can a picture, the date of manufacture cannot be
precisely laid down, hence the vagueness of much of
the classification of old furniture. Roughly it may in
England be dealt with under the Tudor, the Stuart,
and the Georgian ages. These three divisions do
not coincide exactly with the periods of oak, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
walnut, and of mahogany, inasmuch as the oak
furniture extended well into the Stuart days, and
walnut was prevalent in the reigns of George I.
and George II. In any case, these broad divisions
are further divided into sub-heads embracing styles
which arose out of the natural development in taste,
or which came and went at the caprice of fashion.</p>

<p>The formation of a definite English character in
the furniture of the three periods must be examined
in conjunction with the prevailing styles in foreign
furniture showing what influences were at work.
Many conditions governed the introduction of foreign
furniture into England. Renaissance art made a
change in architecture, and a corresponding change
took place in furniture. Ecclesiastical buildings
followed the continental architecture in form and
design, and foreign workmen were employed by the
Church and by the nobility in decorating and embellishing
cathedrals and abbeys and feudal castles.
The early Tudor days under Henry VII. saw the
dawn of the Renaissance in England. Jean de
Mabuse and Torrigiano were invited over the sea
by Henry VII., and under the sturdy impulse of
Henry VIII. classical learning and love of the fine
arts were encouraged. His palaces were furnished
with splendour. He wished to emulate the château
of Francis at Fontainebleau. He tried to entice the
French king's artists with more tempting terms.
Holbein, the great master of the German school,
came to England, and his influence over Tudor art
was very pronounced. The florid manner of the
Renaissance was tempered with the broader treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
of the northern school. The art, too, of the
Flemish woodcarvers
found sympathetic
reception in this
country, and the harmonious
blending of
the designs of the
Renaissance craftsmen
of the Italian
with those of the
Flemish school resulted
in the growth
in England of the
beautiful and characteristic
style known
as Tudor.</p>

<p>The term Renaissance
is used in regard
to that period
in the history of art
which marked the
return to the classic
forms employed by
the Greeks and Romans.
The change
from the Gothic or
Mediæval work to
the classic feeling
had its origin in
Italy, and spread, at
first gradually but later with amazing rapidity and
growing strength, into Germany, Spain, the Netherlands,
France, and finally to England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span></p>

<p>The Renaissance was in origin a literary movement,
and its influence in art came through literature.
The enthusiasm of the new learning acting on craftsmen
already trained to the highest degree of technical
skill produced work of great brilliance.</p>

<p>Never did the fine arts rise to such transcendent
heights as in Italy from the fourteenth to the
middle of the seventeenth centuries. The late John
Addington Symonds, in his work on "The Renaissance
in Italy," deals in a comprehensive manner with this
memorable period, during which every city in Italy,
great or small, was producing wonderful works of art,
in painting, in sculpture, in goldsmiths' work, in woodcarving,
in furniture, of which now every civilised
country struggles to obtain for its art collections the
scattered fragments of these great days. "During
that period of prodigious activity," he says, "the
entire nation seemed to be endowed with an instinct
for the beautiful and with the capacity for producing
it in every conceivable form."</p>

<p>In the middle of the fourteenth century the Renaissance
style in woodwork was at first more evident
in the churches and in the palaces of the nobility in
the Italian states. Some of the most magnificent
examples of carved woodwork are preserved in the
choir-stalls, doorways and panelling of the churches
and cathedrals of Italy. The great artists of the day
gave their talents to the production of woodwork and
furniture in various materials. Wood was chiefly
employed in making furniture, usually oak, cypress,
ebony, walnut, or chestnut, which last wood is very
similar in appearance to oak. These were decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
with gilding and paintings, and were inlaid with other
woods, or agate, lapis-lazuli, and marbles of various
tints, with ivory, tortoiseshell, mother-of-pearl, or with
ornaments of hammered silver.</p>

<p>The Victoria and Albert Museum contains some
splendid examples of fourteenth and fifteenth century
Italian Renaissance furniture, which illustrate well
the magnificence and virility of the great art movement
which influenced the remainder of Europe. In
particular, carved and gilded frames, and marriage
coffers (<i>cassoni</i>) given to brides as part of their
dowry to hold the bridal trousseau, are richly and
effectively decorated. The frame of carved wood
(illustrated p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>), with fine scroll work and female
terminal figures, is enriched with painting and
gilding. The frame on the <a href="#title-page">title-page</a> of this volume
is of carved wood, decorated with gold stucco. Both
these are sixteenth-century Italian work. In fact, the
study of the various types and the different kinds of
ornamentation given to these <i>cassoni</i> would be an
interesting subject for the student, who would find
enough material in the collection at the Victoria and
Albert Museum to enable him to follow the Renaissance
movement from its early days down to the
time when crowded design, over-elaboration, and
inharmonious details grew apace like so many weeds
to choke the ideals of the master spirits of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>The front of the late fifteenth-century coffer
(illustrated p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>) is of chestnut wood, carved with
a shield of arms supported by two male demi-figures,
terminating in floral scroll work. There are still
traces of gilding on the wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<p>At first the lines followed architecture in character.
Cabinets had pilasters, columns, and arches resembling
the old Roman temples. The illustration of a portion
of a cornice of carved pinewood appearing as the
headpiece to this chapter shows this tendency. The
marriage coffers had classic heads upon them, but
gradually this chaste style gave place to rich ornamentation
with designs of griffins and grotesque
masks. The chairs, too, were at first very severe in
outline, usually with a high back and fitted with a
stretcher between the legs, which was carved, as was
also the back of the chair.</p>

<p>In the middle of the fifteenth century Gothic art
had attained its high-water mark in Germany before
the new art from Italy had crossed the Alps. We reproduce
a bridal chest, of the middle of the fifteenth
century, from the collection in the Munich National
Museum, which shows the basis of Gothic art in
England prior to the revival and before further foreign
influences were brought to bear on English art (p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>).</p>

<p>The influence of Italian art upon France soon
made itself felt. Italian architects and craftsmen
were invited by Francis I. and by the Princesses
of the House of Medici, of which Pope Leo X.
was the illustrious head, to build palaces and
châteaux in the Renaissance style. The Tuileries,
Fontainebleau, and the Louvre were the result of
this importation. Primaticcio and Cellini founded
a school of sculptors and wood-carvers in France, of
which Jean Goujon stands pre-eminent. The furniture
began gradually to depart from the old Gothic
traditions, as is shown in the design of the oak chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
of the late fifteenth century preserved in the Dublin
Museum, which we illustrate, and commenced to
emulate the gorgeousness of Italy. This is a particularly
instructive example, showing the transition
between the Gothic and the Renaissance styles.</p>

<p>The French Renaissance sideboard in the illustration

decorated with two male and two female terminal

ornament. Behind the arcading is a table supporting
a cupboard and resting in front on four turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>

which, as well as that of the cupboard, are decorated

<p>The impulse given by Francis I. was responsible
for much decorative work in the early period of
the French Renaissance, and many beautiful examples
exist in the churches and châteaux of France
to which his name has been given. It is noticeable
that the chief difference between the Italian and
the French Renaissance lies in the foundation of
Gothic influence underlying the newer Renaissance
ornament in French work of the period. Flamboyant
arches and Gothic canopies were frequently retained
and mingled with classic decoration. The French
clung to their older characteristics with more
tenacity, inasmuch as the Renaissance was a sudden
importation rather than a natural development of
slower growth.</p>

<p>The French Renaissance cabinet of walnut illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>) is from Lyons, and is of the later
part of the sixteenth century. It is finely carved
with terminal figures, masks, trophies of ornaments,
and other ornament. In comparison with the sixteenth-century
ebony cabinet of the period of
Henry IV., finely inlaid with ivory in most refined
style, it is obvious that a great variety of sumptuous
furniture was being made by the production of such
diverse types as these, and that the craftsmen were
possessed of a wealth of invention. The range of
English craftsmen's designs during the Renaissance
in this country was never so extensive, as can be
seen on a detailed examination of English work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span></p>

<p>In Spain the Italian feeling became acclimatised
more readily than in France. In the sixteenth
century the wood carving of Spain is of exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
beauty. The decoration of the choir of the cathedral
at Toledo is held to be one of the finest examples of
the Spanish Renaissance. In furniture the cabinets
and buffets of the Spanish craftsmen are of perfect
grace and of characteristic design. The older Spanish
cabinets are decorated externally with delicate ironwork
and with columns of ivory or bone painted and
richly gilded, exhibiting Moorish influence in their
character. Many of the more magnificent specimens
are richly inlaid with silver, and are the work of
the artists of Seville, of Toledo, or of Valladolid.
The first illustration of a cabinet and stand is a typically
Spanish design, and the second illustration of the
carved walnut chest in the National Archælogical
Museum at Madrid is of the sixteenth century, when
the Spanish wood-carvers had developed the Renaissance
spirit and reached a very high level in
their art.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the Italianising of French art
a similar wave of novelty was spreading over the
Netherlands and Germany. The Flemish Renaissance
approaches more nearly to the English in the
adaptation of the Italian style, or it would be more
accurate to say that the English is more closely
allied to the art of the Netherlands, as it drew much
of its inspiration from the Flemish wood-carvers. The
spiral turned legs and columns, the strap frets cut out
and applied to various parts, the squares between
turnings often left blank to admit of a little ebony
diamond, are all of the same family as the English
styles. Ebony inlay was frequently used, but the
Flemish work of this period was nearly all in oak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Marqueterie of rich design was made, the inlay being
of various coloured woods and shaded. Mother-of-pearl
and ivory were also employed to heighten the
effect.</p>

<p>The Italian Renaissance laid a light hand upon the
Flemish artists, who, while unavoidably coming under
its influence, at first copied its ornateness but subsequently
proceeded on their own lines. Much quaint
figure work, in which they greatly excelled, was used
by the Flemish wood-carvers in their joinery. It is
grotesque in character, and, like all their work, boldly
executed. The influx of foreign influences upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
Netherlands was in the main as successfully resisted
as is the encroachment of the sea across their land-locked
dykes. The growth of the Spanish power
made Charles V. the most powerful prince in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
Ferdinand of Spain held the whole Spanish peninsula
except Portugal, with Sardinia and the island of
Sicily, and he won the kingdom of Naples. His
daughter Joanna married Philip, the son of Maximilian
of Austria, and of Mary the daughter of
Charles the Bold. Their son Charles thus inherited
kingdoms and duchies from each of his parents and
grandparents, and besides the dominions of Ferdinand
and Isabella, he held Burgundy and the Netherlands.
In 1519 he was chosen Emperor as Charles V.
Flooded with Italian artists and Austrian and Spanish
rulers, it is interesting to note how the national spirit
in art was kept alive, and was of such strong growth
that it influenced in marked manner the English
furniture of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
century, as will be shown in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The opening years of the sixteenth century saw
the beginnings of the Renaissance movement in
England. The oak chest had become a settle with
high back and arms. The fine example of an early
sixteenth-century oak chest illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_59">59</a>) shows
how the Gothic style had impressed itself on articles
of domestic furniture. The credence, or tasting
buffet, had developed into the Tudor sideboard,
where a cloth was spread and candles placed. With
more peaceful times a growth of domestic refinement
required comfortable and even luxurious surroundings.
The royal palaces at Richmond and Windsor were
filled with costly foreign furniture. The mansions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
which were taking the place of the old feudal castles
found employment for foreign artists and craftsmen
who taught the English woodcarver. In the early
days of Henry VIII. the classical style supplanted
the Gothic, or was in great measure mingled with it.
Many fine structures exist which belong to this
transition period, during which the mixed style was
predominant. The woodwork of King's College
Chapel at Cambridge is held to be an especially
notable example.</p>

<p>The Great Hall at Hampton Court dates from
1531, or five years after Cardinal Wolsey had given
up his palace to Henry VIII. Its grand proportions,
its high-pitched roof and pendants, display the art of
the woodcarver in great excellence. This hall, like
others of the same period, had an open hearth in the
centre, on which logs of wood were placed, and the
smoke found its way out through a cupola, or louvre,
in the roof.</p>

<p>The roofs of the Early Tudor mansions were
magnificent specimens of woodwork. But the old
style of king-post, queen-post, or hammer-beam roof
was prevalent. The panelling, too, of halls and
rooms retained the formal character in its mouldings,
and various "linen" patterns were used, so called
from their resemblance to a folded napkin, an ornamentation
largely used towards the end of the
Perpendicular style, which was characteristic of
English domestic architecture in the fifteenth
century. To this period belongs the superb woodcarving
of the renowned choir stalls of Henry VII.'s
Chapel in Westminster Abbey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<p>The bench of oak illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>) shows a
common form of panel with linen ornament, and is
French, of about the year 1500. The seat, as will
be seen, is arranged as a locked coffer.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan woodcarver revelled in grotesque
figure work, in intricate interlacings of strapwork,
borrowed from the Flemish, and ribbon ornamentation,
adapted from the French. He delighted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
massive embellishment of magnificent proportions.
Among Tudor woodwork the carved oak screen of
the Middle Temple Hall is a noteworthy example of
the sumptuousness and splendour of interior decoration
of the English Renaissance. These screens
supporting the minstrels' gallery in old halls are
usually exceptionally rich in detail. Gray's Inn
(dated 1560) and the Charterhouse (dated 1571) are
other examples of the best period of sixteenth-century
woodwork in England.</p>

<p>Christ Church at Oxford, Grimsthorp in Lincolnshire,
Kenninghall in Norfolk, Layer Marney Towers
in Essex, and Sutton Place at Guildford, are all
representative structures typical of the halls and
manor houses being built at the time of the English
Renaissance.</p>

<p>In the Victoria and Albert Museum has been
re-erected a room having the oak panelling from the
"Old Palace" at Bromley-by-Bow, which was built
in 1606. The massive fireplace with the royal coat of
arms above, with the niches in which stand carved
figures of two saints, together with the contemporary
iron fire-dogs standing in the hearth, give a picture of
what an old Elizabethan hall was like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>Under Queen Elizabeth new impulses stirred the
nation, and a sumptuous Court set the fashion in
greater luxury of living. Gloriana, with her merchant-princes,
her fleet of adventurers on the high seas, and
the pomp and circumstance of her troop of foreign
lovers, brought foreign fashions and foreign art into
commoner usage. The growth of luxurious habits in
the people was eyed askance by her statesmen;
"England spendeth more in wines in one year," complained
Cecil, "than it did in ancient times in four
years." The chimney-corner took the place of the
open hearth; chimneys were for the first time familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
features in middle-class houses. The insanitary rush-floor
was superseded by wood, and carpets came into
general use. Even pillows, deemed by the hardy
yeomanry as only fit "for women in child-bed," found
a place in the massive and elaborately carved Elizabethan
bedstead.</p>

<p>The illustration of the fine Elizabethan bedstead (on
p. <a href="#Page_66">66</a>) gives a very good idea of what the domestic
furniture was like in the days immediately succeeding
the Spanish Armada. It is carved in oak; with
columns, tester, and headboard showing the classic
influence. It is ornamented in marquetry, and bears
the date 1593.</p>

<p>All over England were springing up town halls and
fine houses of the trading-classes, and manor houses
and palaces of the nobility worthy of the people
about to establish a formidable position in European
politics. Hatfield House, Hardwick Hall, Audley
End, Burleigh, Knole, and Longleat, all testify to the
Renaissance which swept over England at this time.
Stately terraces with Italian gardens, long galleries
hung with tapestries, and lined with carved oak chairs
and elaborate cabinets were marked features in the
days of the new splendour. Men's minds, led by
Raleigh, the Prince of Company Promoters, and fired
by Drake's buccaneering exploits, turned to the New
World, hitherto under the heel of Spain. Dreams of
galleons laden with gold and jewels stimulated the
ambition of adventurous gallants, and quickened the
nation's pulse. The love of travel became a portion of
the Englishman's heritage. The Italian spirit had
reached England in full force. The poetry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
romances of Italy affected all the Elizabethan men of
letters. Shakespeare, in his "Merchant of Venice"
and his other plays, plainly shows the Italian influence.
In costume, in speech, and in furniture, it
became the fashion to follow Italy. To Ascham it
seemed like "the enchantment of Circe brought out
of Italy to mar men's manners in England."</p>

</div>

<p>The result of this wave of fashion on the domestic
furniture of England was to impart to it the elegance
of Italian art combined with a national sturdiness of
character seemingly inseparable from English art at
all periods. As the reign of Queen Elizabeth extended
from the year 1558 to the year 1603, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
usual to speak of architecture and furniture of the
latter half of the sixteenth century as Elizabethan.</p>

<p>A favourite design in Elizabethan woodwork is the
interlaced strapwork (see illustration p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>), which
was derived from similar designs employed by the
contemporary stonecarver, and is found on Flemish
woodwork of the same period. The panel of a
sixteenth-century Flemish virginal, carved in walnut,
illustrated, shows this form of decoration. Grotesque
terminal figures, half-human, half-monster, supported
the front of the buffets, or were the supporting terminals
of cornices. This feature is an adaptation from the
Caryatides, the supporting figures used instead of
columns in architecture, which in Renaissance days
extended to woodwork. Table-legs and bed-posts
swelled into heavy, acorn-shaped supports of massive
dimensions. Cabinets were sometimes inlaid, as was
also the room panelling, but it cannot be said that at
this period the art of marquetry had arrived at a
great state of perfection in this country.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that in the rare pieces that are
inlaid in the Late Tudor and Early Jacobean period
the inlay itself is a sixteenth of an inch thick, whereas
in later inlays of more modern days the inlay is
thinner and flimsier. In the Flemish examples ivory
was often used, and holly and sycamore and box
seem to have been the favourite woods selected for
inlay.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the mirror with the frame of
carved oak, with scroll outline and narrow bands
inlaid with small squares of wood, alternately light
and dark. This inlay is very coarsely done, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
unworthy to compare with Italian marquetry of contemporary
date, or of an earlier period. The uprights
and feet of the frame, it will be noticed, are baluster-shaped.
The glass mirror is of nineteenth-century
manufacture. The date carved upon the frame is
1603, the first year of the reign of James I., and it is
stated to have come from Derby Old Hall.</p>

</div>

<p>The Court cupboard, also of the same date, begins
to show the coming style of Jacobean ornamentation
in the turning in the upright pillars and supports and
the square baluster termination. The massive carving
and elaborate richness of the early Elizabethan period
have given place to a more restrained decoration.
Between the drawers is the design of a tulip in
marquetry, and narrow bands of inlay are used to
decorate the piece. In place of the chimerical
monsters we have a portrait in wood of a lady, for
which Arabella Stuart might have sat as model.
The days were approaching when furniture was
designed for use, and ornament was put aside if it
interfered with the structural utility of the piece.
The wrought-iron handle to the drawer should be
noted, and in connection with the observation brought
to bear by the beginner on genuine specimens in the
Victoria and Albert Museum and other collections, it
is well not to let any detail escape minute attention.
Hinges and lock escutcheons and handles to drawers
must not be neglected in order to acquire a sound
working knowledge of the peculiarities of the different
periods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span></p>

<p>In contrast with this specimen, the elaborately
carved Court cupboard of a slightly earlier period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
should be examined. It bears carving on every available
surface. It has been "restored," and restored
pieces have an unpleasant fashion of suggesting that
sundry improvements have been carried out in the
process. At any rate, as it stands it is over-laboured,
and entirely lacking in reticence. The elaboration of
enrichment, while executed in a perfectly harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
manner, should convey a lesson to the student of
furniture. There is an absence of contrast; had portions
of it been left uncarved how much more
effective would have been the result! As it is it
stands, wonderful as is the technique, somewhat of a
warning to the designer to cultivate a studied simplicity
rather than to run riot in a profusion of
detail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span></p>

<p>Another interesting Court cupboard, of the early
seventeenth century, shows the more restrained style
that was rapidly succeeding the earlier work. This
piece is essentially English in spirit, and is untouched
save the legs, which have been restored.</p>

<p>The table which is illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>) is a typical
example of the table in ordinary use in Elizabethan
days. This table replaced a stone altar in a church
in Shropshire at the time of the Reformation.</p>

<p>It was late in the reign of Queen Elizabeth that
upholstered chairs became more general. Sir John
Harrington, writing in 1597, gives evidence of this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
the assertion that "the fashion of cushioned chayrs is
taken up in every merchant's house." Wooden seats
had hitherto not been thought too hard, and chairs
imported from Spain had leather seats and backs of
fine tooled work richly gilded and decorated. In the
latter days of Elizabeth loose cushions were used for
chairs and for window seats, and were elaborately
wrought in velvet, or were of satin embroidered in
colours, with pearls as ornamentation, and edged
with gold or silver lace.</p>

<p>The upholstered chair belongs more properly
to the Jacobean period, and in the next chapter
will be shown several specimens of those used by
James I.</p>

<p>In Elizabethan panelling to rooms, in chimneypieces,
doorways, screens such as those built across
the end of a hall and supporting the minstrels'
gallery, the wood used was nearly always English
oak, and most of the thinner parts, such as that
designed for panels and smaller surfaces, was obtained
by splitting the timber, thus exhibiting the beautiful
figure of the wood so noticeable in old examples.</p>

<p>With the advent of the House of Stuart the England
under James I. saw new fashions introduced in
furniture. It has already been mentioned that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
greater number of old houses which are now termed
Tudor or Elizabethan were erected in the days of
James I. At the beginning of a new monarchy
fashion in art rarely changes suddenly, so that the
early pieces of Jacobean furniture differ very little
from Elizabethan in character. Consequently the
Court cupboard, dated 1603, and mirror of the same
year (illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>), though bearing the date
of the first year of the reign of James, more properly
belong to Tudor days.</p>

<p>In the Bodleian Library at Oxford there is preserved
a chair of fine workmanship and of historic
memory. It was made from the oak timbers of the
<i>Golden Hind</i>, the ship in which Sir Francis Drake
made his adventurous voyage of discovery round the
world. In spite of many secret enemies "deaming
him the master thiefe of the unknowne world," Queen
Elizabeth came to Deptford and came aboard the
<i>Golden Hind</i> and "there she did make Captain Drake
knight, in the same ship, for reward of his services;
his armes were given him, a ship on the world, which
ship, by Her Majestie's commandment, is lodged in a
dock at Deptford, for a monument to all posterity."</p>

<p>It remained for many years at Deptford dockyard,
and became the resort of holiday folk, who made
merry in the cabin, which was converted into a
miniature banqueting hall; but when it was too far
decayed to be repaired it was broken up, and a
sufficient quantity of sound wood was selected from
it and made into a chair, which was presented to the
University of Oxford. This was in the time of
Charles II., and the poet Cowley has written some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
lines on it, in which he says that Drake and his
<i>Golden Hind</i> could not have wished a more blessed
fate, since to "this Pythagorean ship"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">" ... a seat of endless rest is given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her in Oxford, and to him in heaven&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, though quite unintentional on the part of the
poet, is curiously satiric.</p>

<p>The piece is highly instructive as showing the
prevailing design for a sumptuous chair in the late
seventeenth century. The middle arch in the back of
the chair is disfigured by a tablet with an inscription,
which has been placed there.</p>

OAK TABLE, DATED 1616, BEARING ARMS OF THOMAS SUTTON,
FOUNDER OF THE CHARTERHOUSE HOSPITAL.</span>
</div>

<p>Of the early days of James I. is a finely carved oak
table, dated 1616. This table is heavily moulded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
carved with garlands between cherubs' heads, and
shields bearing the arms of Thomas Sutton, the
founder of the Charterhouse Hospital. The upper
part of the table is supported on thirteen columns,
with quasi-Corinthian columns and enriched shafts,
standing on a moulded <b>H</b>-shaped base. It will be
seen that the designers had not yet thrown off the
trammels of architecture which dominated much of
the Renaissance woodwork. The garlands are not
the garlands of Grinling Gibbons, and although
falling within the Jacobean period, it lacks the charm
which belong to typical Jacobean pieces.</p>

<p>At Knole, in the possession of Lord Sackville, there
are some fine specimens of early Jacobean furniture,
illustrations of which are included in this volume.
The chair used by King James I. when sitting to the
painter Mytens is of peculiar interest. The cushion,
worn and threadbare with age, is in all probability the
same cushion used by James. The upper part of the
chair is trimmed with a band of gold thread. The
upholstering is red velvet, and the frame, which is of
oak, bears traces of gilding upon it, and is studded
with copper nails. The chair in design, with the
half circular supports, follows old Venetian patterns.
The smaller chair is of the same date, and equally
interesting as a fine specimen; the old embroidery,
discoloured and worn though it be, is of striking
design and must have been brilliant and distinctive
three hundred years ago. The date of these pieces
is about 1620, the year when the "Pilgrim Fathers"
landed in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p>From the wealth of Jacobean furniture at Knole it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
is difficult to make a representative selection, but the
stool we reproduce (p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>) is interesting, inasmuch as
it was a piece of furniture in common use. The
chairs evidently were State chairs, but the footstool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
was used in all likelihood by those who sat below the
salt, and were of less significance. The stuffed settee
which finds a place in the billiard-room at Knole
and the sumptuous sofa in the Long Gallery, with its
mechanical arrangement for altering the angle at the
head, are objects of furniture difficult to equal. The
silk and gold thread coverings are faded, and the
knotted fringe and gold braid have tarnished under
the hand of Time, but their structural design is so
effective that the modern craftsman has made luxurious
furniture after these models.</p>

<p>Carved oak chests were not largely made in
Jacobean days&mdash;not, at any rate, for the same purpose
as they were in Tudor or earlier times. As church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
coffers they doubtless continued to be required, but for
articles of domestic furniture other than as linen chests
their multifarious uses had vanished. Early Jacobean
coffers clearly show the departure from Elizabethan
models. They become more distinctly English in
feeling, though the interlaced ribbon decoration, so
frequently used, is an adaptation from French work,
which pattern was now becoming acclimatised. The
French carved oak coffer of the second half of the
sixteenth century (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>) shows from what
source some of the English designs were derived.</p>

<p>In the portion of the French door which we give as
an illustration (on p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>), it will be seen with what
grace and artistic excellence of design and with what
restraint the French woodcarvers utilised the running
ribbon. The ribbon pattern has been variously used
by designers of furniture; it appears in Chippendale's
chair-backs, where it almost exceeds the limitations of
the technique of woodcarving.</p>

<p>Art in the early days of Charles I. was undimmed.
The tapestry factory at Mortlake, established by
James I., was further encouraged by the "White
King." He took a great and a personal interest in
all matters relating to art. Under his auspices the
cartoons of Raphael were brought to England to
foster the manufacture of tapestry. He gave his
patronage to foreign artists and to foreign craftsmen,
and in every way attempted to bring English art
workers into line with their contemporaries on the
Continent. Vandyck came over to become "Principal
painter of Their Majesties at St. James's," keeping
open table at Blackfriars and living in almost regal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
style. His grace and distinction and the happy
circumstance of his particular style being coincident
with the most picturesque period in English costume,
have won him a place among
the world's great painters. Fine
portraits, at Windsor and at
Madrid, at Dresden and at
the Pitti Palace, at the Louvre
and in the Hermitage at Petersburg,
testify to the European
fame of the painter's brilliant
gallery representing the finest
flower of the English aristocracy,
prelates, statesmen, courtiers
and beautiful women that
were gathered together at the
Court of Charles I. and his
Queen Henrietta Maria.</p>

<p>In Early Stuart days the
influence of Inigo Jones, the
Surveyor of Works to Charles
I., made itself felt in woodwork
and interior decorations. He
was possessed with a great love
and reverence for the classicism
of Italy, and introduced
into his banqueting hall at
Whitehall (now the United
Service Museum), and St. Paul's,
Covent Garden, a chaster style, which was taken up
by the designers of furniture, who began to abandon
the misguided use of ornament of later Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
days. In the Victoria and Albert Museum is an oak
chair with the arms of Thomas Wentworth, first
Earl of Strafford, which, in addition to its historic
interest, is a fine example of the chair of the period
of Charles I. (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>In the illustration of a sixteenth-century chair in
common use in Italy, it will
be seen to what source the
Jacobean woodworkers looked
for inspiration. The fine,
high-backed oak Stuart chair,
elaborately carved with bold
shell and scroll foliage, having
carved supports, stuffed
upholstered seats, and loose
cushion covered in old Spanish
silk damask, is a highly interesting
example. It was
long in the possession of the
Stuart MacDonald family, and
is believed to have belonged
to Charles I.</p>

<p>The gate-leg table, sometimes
spoken of as Cromwellian,
belongs to this Middle
Jacobean style. It cannot be
said with any degree of accuracy
that in the Commonwealth
days a special style of furniture
was developed. From all evidence it would seem
that the manufacture of domestic furniture went on
in much the same manner under Cromwell as under
Charles. Iconoclasts as were the Puritans, it is
doubtful whether they extended their work of destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
to articles in general use. The bigot had
"no starch in his linen, no gay furniture in his
house." Obviously the Civil War very largely interfered
with the encouragement and growth of the fine
arts, but when furniture had to be made there is no
doubt the Roundhead cabinetmaker and the Anabaptist
carpenter produced as good joinery and
turning as they did before Charles made his historic
descent upon the House in his attempt to arrest the
five members.</p>

<p>There is a style of chair, probably imported from
Holland, with leather back and leather seat which is
termed "Cromwellian," probably on account of its
severe lines, but there is no direct evidence that this
style was peculiarly of Commonwealth usage. The
illustration (p. <a href="#Page_97">97</a>) gives the type of chair, but the
covering is modern.</p>

<p>That Cromwell himself had no dislike for the fine
arts is proved by his care of the Raphael cartoons,
and we are enabled to reproduce an illustration of
a fine old ebony cabinet with moulded front, fitted
with numerous drawers, which was formerly the
property of Oliver Cromwell. It was at Olivers
Stanway, once the residence of the Eldred family.
The stand is carved with shells and scrolls, and the
scroll-shaped legs are enriched with carved female
figures, the entire stand being gilded. This piece is
most probably of Italian workmanship, and was of
course made long before the Protector's day, showing
marked characteristics of Renaissance style.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span></p>

attention is the wooden peg in the joinery, securing

pieces. It will be noticed in several places in this
cradle. In modern imitations, unless very thoughtfully
reproduced, these oaken pegs are not visible.</p>

later date shows in the stretcher the wear given by
the feet of the sitters. It is an interesting piece; the
stiles in the back are inlaid with pearwood and ebony.
The other armchair with its cane panels in back is of
later Stuart days. It shows the transitional stage
between the scrolled-arm type of chair, wholly of
wood, and the more elaborate type (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>)

<p>In addition to the finer pieces of seventeenth-century
furniture to be found in the seats of the
nobility, such as at Penshurst, or in the manor houses
and homes of the squires and smaller landowners,
there was much furniture of a particularly good
design in use at farmsteads from one end of the
country to the other, in days when a prosperous
class of yeoman followed the tastes of their richer
neighbours. This farmhouse furniture is nowadays
much sought after. It was of local manufacture, and
is distinctly English in its character. Oak dressers
either plain or carved, were made not only in Wales&mdash;"Welsh
Dressers" having become almost a trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
term&mdash;but in various parts of England, in Yorkshire,
in Derbyshire, in Sussex, and in Suffolk. They are
usually fitted with two or three open shelves, and
sometimes with cupboards on each side. The better
preserved specimens have still their old drop-handles
and hinges of brass. It is not easy to procure fine
examples nowadays, as it became fashionable two
or three years ago to collect these, and in addition
to oak dressers from the farmhouses of Normandy,
equally old and quaint, which were imported to
supply a popular demand, a great number of modern
imitations were made up from old wood&mdash;church
pews largely forming the framework of the dressers,
which were not difficult to imitate successfully.</p>

<p>The particular form of chair known as the "Yorkshire
chair" is of the same period. Certain localities
seem to have produced peculiar types of chairs which
local makers made in great numbers. It will be
noticed that even in these conditions, with a continuous
manufacture going on, the patterns were not
exact duplicates of each other, as are the machine-made
chairs turned out of a modern factory, where the
maker has no opportunity to introduce any personal
touches, but has to obey the iron law of his machine.</p>

<p>As a passing hint to collectors of old oak furniture,
it may be observed that it very rarely happens that
two chairs can be found together of the same design.
There may be a great similarity of ornament and a
particularly striking resemblance, but the chair with
its twin companion beside it suggests that one, if not
both, are spurious. The same peculiarity is exhibited
in old brass candlesticks, and especially the old Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
brass with circular platform in middle of candlestick.
One may handle fifty without finding two that are
turned with precisely the same form of ornament.</p>

<p>The usual feature of the chair which is termed
"Yorkshire" is that it has an open back in the form
of an arcade, or a back formed with two crescent-shaped
cross-rails, the decorations of the back usually
bearing acorn-shaped knobs either at the top of the
rail or as pendants. This type is not confined to
Yorkshire, as they have frequently been found in
Derbyshire, in Oxfordshire, and in Worcestershire,
and a similar variety may be found in old farmhouses
in East Anglia.</p>

<p>In the illustration of the two oak chairs (p. <a href="#Page_105">105</a>), the
one with arms is of the Charles I. period, the other is
later and belongs to the latter half of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>The Jacobean oak cupboard (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_101">101</a>) is
in date about 1620. At the side there are perforations
to admit air, which shows that it was used
as a butter cupboard. The doors have an incised
decoration of conventional design. The lower part
is carved in style unmistakably Jacobean in nature.
The pattern on the two uprights at the top is repeatedly
found in pieces evidently designed locally
for use in farmhouses.</p>

<p>It is not too much to hope that enough has been
said concerning Jacobean furniture of the early and
middle seventeenth century to show that it possesses
a peculiar charm and simplicity in the lines of its
construction, which make it a very pleasing study to
the earnest collector who wishes to procure a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
genuine specimens of old furniture, which, while
being excellent in artistic feeling, are not unprocurable
by reason of their rarity and excessive cost. It should
be within the power of the careful collector, after
following the hints in this volume, and after examining
well-selected examples in such a collection as that
at the Victoria and Albert Museum, to obtain, without
unreasonable expenditure, after patient search, one
or two Jacobean pieces of undoubted authenticity.</p>

<p>After the Civil War, when Charles II. came into his
own again, the furniture of the Restoration period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
most certainly took its colour from the gay Court with
which the Merry Monarch surrounded himself. The
cabinet which we reproduce has the royal arms
embroidered on the cover, and is a beautiful example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
of intricate cabinetmaking. The surface of the piece
is entirely covered with needlework. On the front
stand a cavalier and lady, hand-in-hand. On the
side panel a cavalier is leading a lady on horseback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
On the back a man drives a laden camel, and on
another panel is shown the traveller being received
by an old man in the grounds of the same castle
which appears all through the scenes. This suggests
the love-story of some cavalier and his lady. The
casket is worthy to have held the love-letters of the
Chevalier Grammont to La Belle Hamilton.</p>

Showing interior and nest of drawers.</span>
</div>

<p>As is usual in pieces of this nature, the cabinet
contains many artfully devised hiding places. A
tiny spring behind the lock reveals one secret drawer,
and another is hidden beneath the inkwell. There
are in all five of such secret compartments&mdash;or rather
five of them have been at present discovered&mdash;there
may be more. The illustration of the cabinet open
shows what a nest of drawers it holds.</p>

<p>In the days of plots, when Titus Oates set half the
nation by the ears, when James solemnly warned
the merry Charles of plots against his life, provoking
the cynical retort, "They will never kill me,
James, to make you king," secret drawers were no
doubt a necessity to a fashionable cabinet.</p>

<p>Catherine of Braganza, his queen, brought with her
from Portugal many sumptuous fashions in furniture,
notably cabinets and chairs of Spanish and Portuguese
workmanship. The cavaliers scattered by the Civil
War returned, and as in their enforced exile on the
Continent they had cultivated foreign tastes, it was
only natural that Dutch, French, and Italian work
found its way to this country and effected the
character of the early furniture of the Charles II.
period. From Portugal came the high-backed chair,
having the back and the seat of leather cut with fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
design, and coloured or gilded. This leather work
is of exquisite character, and we reproduce a portion
of a Portuguese chair-back of this period to show the
artistic excellence of the design. With Catherine of
Braganza came the marriage dower of Bombay, and
from India, where the settlement
of Goa had been
Portuguese for centuries,
were sent to Europe the
carved chairs in ebony,
inlaid in ivory, made
by the native workmen
from Portuguese and
Italian models, but enriched
with pierced carving
and intricate inlay
of ivory in a manner
which only an Oriental
craftsman can produce.
Having become fashionable
in Portugal, they
made their appearance
in England, and rapidly
became popular. At
Penshurst Place there
are several fine specimens
of this Indo-Portuguese
work, with the
spindles of the chair-backs
of carved ivory; and in the Ashmolean Museum
at Oxford there is the well-known chair which was
presented by Charles II. to Elias Ashmole.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

<p>Both in this later Stuart period and in the days of
the first Charles inlay was considerably used to
heighten the carved designs on oak tables, chairs,
and cabinets. The growth of commerce was responsible
for the introduction of many varieties of foreign
woods, which were used to produce finer effects in
marquetry than the rude inlay of Elizabethan days.</p>

<p>The <a href="#frontispiece">Frontispiece</a> to this volume represents a very
handsome cabinet of English workmanship, inlaid
with ivory and mother-of-pearl. It is an unusually
fine example of the middle seventeenth century, and
bears the date 1653, the year when Cromwell forcibly
dissolved the Rump Parliament and was declared
"Lord Protector of the Commonwealth."</p>

<p>Up till now oak&mdash;the hard, tough, English variety,
and not the more modern Baltic oak or American
varieties now used&mdash;was the material for the tool of
the carver to work upon. With the introduction of
more flowing lines and curves, a wealth of detail, it
is not unnatural to find that softer woods began to
find favour as more suitable to the new decorations.
The age of walnut was approaching when, under
William the Dutchman, and in the days of Queen
Anne, a newer style of furniture was to arise, made by
craftsmen trained in the precepts of Grinling Gibbons
and following the conceptions of Sir Christopher
Wren. It must be borne in mind that in Italy the
softer woods, such as lime, willow, sycamore, chestnut,
walnut, and cypress, had long been used for the
delicate carving during the height of the Renaissance
and succeeding period, and in France and Spain
chestnut and walnut were favourite woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span></p>

<p>In the central panel of the Restoration chair-back,
canework began to be used instead of the Early
Jacobean carving. Cane seats were frequent, and
loose cushions, attached by means of strings, covered
these cane panels and seats. The illustration (p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>)
shows a Jacobean chair of this period.</p>

</div>

<p>Belonging to these later Jacobean days are chests
of drawers of oak with finely panelled fronts. We
illustrate two specimens, showing the old brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
metal work and the drop-handles. They are usually
in two parts, and are very deep from back to front.
These are two typical examples of this kind of furniture,
which was in general use up to the days of
Queen Anne, when pieces are frequently found
supported on a stand.</p>

<p>In the picture by Caspar Netscher, showing a
Dutch lady at her toilet, a good idea is conveyed of
the kind of chair in use in Holland in the latter half
of the seventeenth century, upholstered in brocade,
and the rich tapestry tablecloth is a noticeable
feature.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the last phase of Stuart furniture,
and leaving the days of Jacobean oak with its
fine carving and handsome appearance&mdash;the careful
result of selecting the timber and splitting it to show
the fine figure of the wood&mdash;the attention of the reader
should be drawn to the fact that the appearance of
the surface of furniture made subsequent to this
period begins to approach the results of the modern
cabinetmaker with his polishes and spirit varnishes
and highly glazed panels and table tops. The lover
of old oak abominates varnish. The Elizabethan
and Jacobean carved oak furniture received only
a preliminary coat of dark varnish in its early
days, mixed with oil and not spirit, which sank into
the wood and was not a surface polish, and was
probably used to preserve the wood. These old
pieces, which have received centuries of rubbing with
beeswax and oil, have resulted in producing a rich,
warm tone which it is impossible to copy by any of
the subtle arts known to the modern forger. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
collector should make himself thoroughly familiar
with the appearance of this old oak by a careful
examination of museum pieces, which, when once
seen, cannot easily be forgotten.</p>

<p>The Italian Renaissance furniture probably received
an oil varnish, the composition of which, like the
varnish employed for old violins, has been lost, but
after centuries of careful usage and polishing, the
result, as seen in the fine specimens in the Victoria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
and Albert Museum, is to give to them the appearance
of bronze.</p>

</div>

<p>There is little doubt that the Great Fire, which did
such immense destruction in London in 1666, in
which some eighty-nine churches and thirteen
thousand houses were demolished,
gave a considerable
impetus to the manufacture
of furniture in the
new style. It is not a
pleasing reflection to think
how many fine pieces
of Elizabethan and early
Jacobean furniture were
consumed in the flames,
including much of Inigo
Jones's work.</p>

<p>Under the genius of Sir
Christopher Wren many
of the city churches were
rebuilt, including St. Paul's
Cathedral; and Greenwich
Hospital and Hampton
Court were enlarged according
to Wren's designs,
with the co-operation of
the master woodcarver,
Grinling Gibbons. In later
Jacobean days a splendour of style and an excellence
of workmanship were the outcome of the fine achievements
in interior woodwork by Grinling Gibbons and
the school he founded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span></p>

<p>The work of Grinling Gibbons consisted of most
natural chains of flowers and foliage, fruit, or birds or
cherubs' heads, all faithfully reproduced untrammelled
by convention. St. Paul's Cathedral, Hampton
Court, Chatsworth, and
Petworth House all contain
work by him of
singular beauty. He
trained many assistants
to help him to carry
on his work, and one
of them, Selden, lost his
life in endeavouring to
save the carved room
at Petworth from a destructive
fire. The soft
wood of the lime was
his favourite for detailed
carving; for church
panelling or choir stalls,
such as at St. Pauls, he
employed oak; in his
medallion portraits or
figure work he preferred
pear or close-grained
boxwood.</p>

</div>

<p>The gradual development
of the chair in the
later Stuart days in the direction of upholstered seat
will be noticed in the specimens which are given as
illustrations. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes
in 1685 by Louis XIV. drove some thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
of French workmen&mdash;weavers, glass-workers, and
cabinetmakers&mdash;to this country. The silk-weaving
industry established by them at Spitalfields
was one of the results, and
silk stuffs and brocades were
used for covering the seats
and backs of furniture. At
Hampton Court the crystal
glass chandeliers were made
by French workmen, whom
Wren was glad to employ
to assist him to make that
palace a worthy rival to
Versailles.</p>

<br />

</div>

<p>The chair here illustrated
shows the commencement
of the use of cane
work in place of wood for
the panel in back and for
the seat. The James II.
chair illustrated shows the
later development of the
cane-back. The William
and Mary chair (illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>) shows how the cane-back
was retained later than
the cane-seat, and how rich
damask was employed for
the upholstered seat. It is
interesting to see how the stretcher, which in earlier
days was of use to keep the feet raised from a wet or
draughty floor, has now become capable of elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
ornamentation. Genuine examples of chairs of
Elizabethan and Early Stuart days show the wear
of the feet of the sitters. The same wear is
observable in the lower rail
of old tables. In later
Stuart days the stretcher
has left its place at the
bottom, between the two
front legs. Since its use
as a foot-rest, owing to
carpeted floors, is gone, it
is found either joining the
legs diagonally, or higher
up as an ornament with
carved front. In the eighteenth
century it has almost
disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Mirrors began to take a
prominent place in interior
decoration. The house of
Nell Gwynne in St. James's
Square had one room entirely
lined with glass
mirrors. Hampton Court
is full of mirrors, and they
are arranged with considerable
skill. By an artful
arrangement the mirror in
the King's Writing Closet is placed at such an
angle that the reflection of the whole suite of rooms
may be seen in it. The looking glasses made in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
country in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries were the work of Venetian and French
workmen. The plates had a bevel of an inch in
width, and these bevels followed the shape of the
frame, whether square or oval. A factory was established
near Battersea which produced some fine
work of this nature. It will be noticed by the
collector who is observant that the bevels differ
considerably from modern bevels. The angle is
not such an acute one, and sometimes the edges
are double bevelled. Many of the mirrors of the
time of William and Mary had an ornamented
border of blue glass. Sometimes the mirror was
painted with festoons of flowers and with birds in
French manner. In imitation of Italian style the
back of the mirror, in examples a little later, was
worked upon in the style of intaglio, or gem cutting,
this presenting a dull silver surface when seen from

<p>In picture frames, in chimneypieces, or in mirror
frames the school of Grinling Gibbons was still pre-eminent
in carving. Now and again are found traces
of Italian or Louis XIV. influence, but as a whole the
English carver held his own, and the traditions of
Grinling Gibbons were maintained, and he did not
easily allow himself to be carried away by foreign
elaborations.</p>

<p>When William of Orange came over in 1688 he
brought with him many of his own countrymen as
military and civil advisers, and in their train came
artists and craftsmen, who introduced Dutch art into
England, and prepared the way for the more homely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
style of Queen Anne. Walnut cabinets inlaid with
various woods, and with ivory squares representing
miniature Dutch courtyards in the recesses of
cabinets, had found their way into England. With
the period of William and Mary the cabriole leg in
chairs and in tables became popular&mdash;at first an
English adaptation of Dutch models&mdash;but later to
develop into the glorious creations of the age of
walnut.</p>

<p>Blue delft jars and bowls, some especially made for
William and Mary and bearing the Royal arms and
the cypher "W. M. R." and the Nassau motto,
"<i>Je main tien-dray</i>," still to be seen in the Queen's
Gallery at Hampton Court, were introduced, and it
became fashionable to collect china. Consequently
the furniture in rooms had to be adapted for the
arrangement of this new class of ornament, and
cabinets were largely made with accommodation to
receive vases and beakers and blue bowls on their
shelves. The earlier form have straight sides; but
later, especially in the next reign, they follow French
designs, and are swollen or <i>bombé</i> at the sides.</p>

<p>With William, too, came over the plain walnut
card-table. Clock cases of the style termed "Grandfather"
were of Dutch origin. The seats of chairs
were shaped and removable. The Dutch trade with
the East Indies had brought Oriental china and lac
cabinets into Holland, and these, with the coming of
William, found their way into this country. Bureaux
with a number of secret recesses were introduced,
and another Dutch importation from the East was
the now celebrated chair or table leg with claw and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
ball foot. This came directly from China, and as in
the case of delft, which is the earthenware replica by
the Dutch potter of fine blue porcelain vases,
from Nankin and Canton, where the Oriental perspective
and design have been slavishly copied, so
with the furniture, the old Chinese symbol of a
dragon's foot holding a pearl, was repeated in the
furniture by Dutch cabinetmakers. Dutch marquetry
made an early appearance with simple ornamentation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
sometimes enriched by ivory or mother-of-pearl
inlay, but later it developed into flowing floral designs
with figures, vases, fruit, butterflies, and elaborate
scrolls in various coloured woods, of which yellow
was the predominant colour.</p>

<p>With the age of Queen Anne domestic furniture
departed from the ornate characteristics which had
marked previous epochs. The tendency in English
furniture seems to have made towards comfort and
homeliness. The English home may not have contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
so many articles of luxury then as does the
modern house with its artistic embellishments, and a
popular taste rapidly ripening into a genuine love of
the fine arts. "A modern shopkeeper's house," says
Lord Macaulay, "is as well furnished as the house of
a considerable merchant in Anne's reign." It is very
doubtful whether this statement holds good with
regard to the days of Elizabeth or the days of the
early Stuarts, but there certainly seems to have been
in the dawn of the walnut period a curtailment of
luxurious effects that might well tempt a casual
observer to generalise in the belief that the days of
Anne spelt dulness in art.</p>

<p>The settle, the illustration of which is given (p. <a href="#Page_149">149</a>),
bearing the date 1705, the year after Blenheim, shows
that Jacobean models of early days were not forgotten.
The inlaid borders are very effective, and
there is nothing vulgar or offensive in the carving.
It is simple in style and the joinery is good. A
walnut mirror, carved and gilded (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_137">137</a>),
exhibits the same solidity. There is nothing to show
that the glorious age of Louis XIV. had produced
the most sumptuous and richly decorated furniture
the modern world had seen. The simplicity of this
carved mirror frame is as though art had begun and
ended in England, and probably it is this insularity
of the furniture of this period, and the almost stubborn
neglect of the important movements going
on in France that makes the Queen Anne style of
peculiar interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span></p>

<p>The oak desk illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>), dated 1696, is

<p>Some pretty effects were now obtained by veneering,
which was largely coming into practice. The
pieces with the burr-walnut panels, marked in a series
of knot-like rings, are especially sought after. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>

<p>In the fine cabinet, the illustration of which is
given (p. <a href="#Page_141">141</a>), the style is typical of this period.
The panels of the doors are of exquisite finish, and
show a beautiful walnut grain of peculiarly-pleasing
mottled appearance, and the mellow effect which
time has given to this specimen cannot be imitated
with any degree of success in modern replicas. In
the illustration showing this piece when open, the
rich effect of the walnut in the middle panel may be
noticed; the contemporary brass handles to the
nest of drawers are typical of this style.</p>

<p>In chairs and in tables the elegant cabriole and
colt's-foot legs were now commonly adopted, and
apparently, simple as is the construction, it is only
when Queen Anne pieces come to be repaired that it
is found how expensive an undertaking it is, owing
to their ingenious construction and the patient labour
that was expended upon them, to produce unpretentious
and harmonious effects.</p>

<p>The assertively English spirit which was the
dominant note of the furniture of the early eighteenth
century continued up till the early years of the reign
of George II. During this period, which covers half
a century, walnut was the wood mostly used in the
manufacture of furniture, and this walnut period
shows a quiet dignity of style and a simple proportion,
reticently elegant and inornate without being
severe.</p>

<p>The Queen Anne oak settle, with shaped panelled
back and scroll arms, which appears as the headpiece
to this chapter, is especially representative of the kind
of piece in common use at the time; oak was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
employed in furniture of this nature. The legs show
the newer design, which was already departing from
the elegant turning of earlier Jacobean days.</p>

<p>In the Queen Anne chair which is illustrated in the
group of chairs of this period (p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>), with open back
and carved scroll foliage, the cabriole legs are finely
carved with lion masks and acanthus leaf ornament,
on lion's claw-and-ball feet. The seat is removable,
and is stuffed. Queen Anne chairs had high carved
or plain splat backs. The armchair in the same
group shows this type of back. The Dutch shell-pattern
often appears either on back or at the juncture
of the leg with the seat. Chairs decorated in
marquetry, in Dutch fashion, were in use at this
period. The one illustrated with the two above-mentioned
chairs is inlaid with birds and flowers,
and the legs are cabriole. The seat follows the
growing usage of being loose and stuffed.</p>

<p>Dutch marquetry cabinets on stands, with straight
uprights, were imported and became a feature in the
early eighteenth century drawing-room (see illustration,
p. <a href="#Page_147">147</a>). The earlier forms had straight sides,
but later, as the fashion grew, bureaux and large
cabinets, with the dimensions of a modern wardrobe,
had taken their place, with <i>bombé</i> or swelled sides,
and profusely decorated in marquetry, with vases
and tulips and unnamed flowers of the cabinetmaker's
invention, birds, butterflies, and elaborate
scrollwork, in which ivory and mother-of-pearl were
often employed as an inlay.</p>

<p>The stands on which the smaller cabinets stood
were turned with the spiral leg of Jacobean days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
later they have the cabriole leg, with ball-and-claw
or club feet. Cabinets
and stands are
frequently found
together, in which
the one is much
earlier than the
other.</p>

</div>

<p>Rich damask began
to be used in
the furnishing of
hangings, and in
some of the palatial
furniture of the
period the looms
of Spitalfields produced
the coverings.
In Queen
Anne's bedroom
the hangings were
of rich silk velvet.</p>

<p>Clocks of the
variety termed
"Grandfather,"
either with fine
walnut cases or
inlaid with marquetry,
came into
more general use in
the days of Queen
Anne. An elaboration
of carving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
on grandfather clock cases
as a rule is to be regarded
with suspicion. Plain panels
are not so saleable as carved
ones; the want is supplied,
and many fine old clock
cases are spoiled by having
the touch of a modern hand.
The clock illustrated is an
untouched specimen. The
walnut case is a fine example
of Queen Anne marquetry
work. The works are by
Sam Barrow, Hermitage
Bridge, London. The steel
dial is richly mounted with
cupids, masks, and scrolls in
chased brass.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the
eighteenth century and later,
cabinets of Dutch importation,
and Japanese or Chinese
in origin, were extensively
in use. In smaller numbers
they had, without doubt, in
the days of William and
Mary, been introduced, but it
was not until the commerce
with the East had been
well established that they
became popular. In the
cabinet illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
the cabinet-work is English, the drawers are all
dovetailed in the English manner, but the lacquered
doors come from the East. It is an especially
interesting example, as the pagoda-like superstructure
is not often found complete.</p>

<p>Lacquered boxes had been sent home from the
East by English, French, and Dutch merchants, for
many years, and with characteristic ingenuity the
French cabinetmakers had employed these as panels
for their furniture, but the supply not being sufficient
they had attempted a lacquer of their own, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>

<p>In the early eighteenth century the English craftsman
tried his skill at lacquered furniture, it is true
not with very successful results, but it is interesting
to see what he has left as attempts. The illustration
(p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>) of a chair in black and gold lac is of English
manufacture. The splat back and the cabriole leg
give the date, and the specimen is a noteworthy
example. Another piece of the first half of the
eighteenth century
period is the
lac cabinet illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_151">151</a>).
The metal hinges
and corners of
this are of chased
brass and of English
or Dutch
workmanship.
The shape and
design of the
drawer handles
are frequently
found in nests of
drawers of this period, and there was a singular fondness
shown at this time for numbers of small drawers
and pigeon-holes in furniture. The now familiar
bureau with bookcase above, and drop-down, sloping
front covering drawers and recesses, dates from this
time. The escutcheon of the lac cabinet is illustrated
in detail as a tailpiece to this chapter to show the
particular style of work found on the locks and hinges
and drawer-handles of pieces of this nature. As has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
been said before, it is especially useful to the collector
to make himself thoroughly familiar with these details
of the various periods.</p>

<p>It may be readily imagined that at a time when
cards were the passion of everybody in society, the
card-table became a necessary piece of furniture in
eighteenth-century days, just before the dawn of the
great age of mahogany, when Chippendale, and the
school that followed him, eagerly worked in the wood
which Raleigh discovered. They produced countless
forms, both original and adapted from the French,
which have enriched the <i>répertoire</i> of the cabinetmaker
and which have brought fame to the man
whose designs added lustre to the reputation of
English furniture.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a sense of proportion as to the
value of English furniture and its relation to contemporary
art in Europe, it is necessary to pass under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
hasty examination the movements that were taking
place in France in the creation of a new style in
furniture under the impulses of the epoch of the
<i>Grande Monarque</i>. To estimate more correctly the
styles of the Early Jacobean and of the later English
furniture extending to the days of Chippendale and
Sheraton, it must be borne in mind that England
was not always so insular in art as the days of Queen
Anne would seem to indicate. It is impossible for the
cabinetmakers and the craftsmen to have utterly
ignored the splendours of France. Louis XIV. had
a long and eventful reign, which extended from the
days when Charles I. was marshalling his forces to
engage in civil war with the Parliament down to the
closing years of Queen Anne. During his minority
it cannot be said that Louis XIV. influenced art in
furniture, but from 1661, contemporary with Charles
II., when he assumed the despotic power that he
exercised for half a century, his love of sumptuousness,
and his personal supervision of the etiquette of a
formal Court, in which no detail was omitted to
surround royalty with magnificence, made him the
patron of the fine arts, and gave his Court the most
splendid prestige in Europe.</p>

<p>As a headpiece to this chapter we give a very fine
example of a <i>cassette</i>, or strong box, of the time of
Louis XIV. It is securely bound with metal bands
of exquisite design. The interior is fitted with a
number of secret drawers.</p>

<p>In the illustration (p. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>) it will be seen that the
chair of the period of Louis Treize differed in no great
respects from the furniture under the early Stuarts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
this country. This design is by the celebrated Crispin
de Passe, and the date is when Charles I. raised his
standard at Nottingham, a year prior to the birth of
Louis XIV.</p>

DESIGNED BY CRISPIN DE PASSE, 1642.</span>
</div>

<p>During the reign of Louis XIV.,
tables, armoires, and cabinets were
designed on architectural principles.
Under the guiding influence
of Colbert, Minister of Finance,
architects and cabinetmakers were
selected to design furniture for the
Tuileries, the Louvre, and Fontainebleau.
In the
early years of the
reign furniture was
made with severe
lines, but gradually
it became the practice
to fashion larger
pieces. Immense
tables with sumptuous
decoration, on
gilded claw-feet, and
having tops inlaid
with <i>pietra-dura</i> intended
to carry
bronze groups and
porphyry vases,
were made at the
Gobelins factory, under the direction of the celebrated
Le Brun. This artist loved grandeur and gorgeousness
in decoration, and in accord with the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
ideas of Louis XIV., who had an inordinate love for
perfect symmetry, huge pieces of furniture were built
in magnificent manner to please the taste of the
<i>Grande Monarque</i>. Men of genius were employed in
the manufacture of tapestries, of furniture, and of
metal mountings, and the interior decorations of the
palaces were designed in harmony with the furniture
intended for use therein.</p>

<p>The most illustrious among the cabinetmakers was
André Charles Boule, who was made, in 1673, by
letters patent, <i>Premier ébéniste de la maison royale</i>.
The work of this artist in wood has attained a worldwide
celebrity, and his name even has been corrupted
into "buhl" to denote a particular class of work
which he perfected. His most notable productions
are the finely chased ormolu, in which he was an
accomplished worker, and the inlay of tortoiseshell
and brass, sometimes varied with ebony or silver,
which have remained the wonder of succeeding
generations.</p>

<p>Boule was born in 1642, and lived till 1732. The
first Boule, termed "<i>Le Père</i>," he was succeeded by no
less than four sons and nephews of the same name, in
addition to his pupils who carried on his traditions at
the Boule <i>atelier</i>, and a crowd of later imitators, even
up to the present day, have followed his style in lavish
decoration without being possessed of his skill.</p>

<p>In Italy and in France marquetry of considerable
delicacy and of fine effect had been produced long
before the epoch of Louis XIV., but it was Boule
who introduced a novelty into marquetry by his
veneered work, which rapidly grew into favour till it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
developed into cruder colouring in inlays and unbridled
licence in ornamentation, to which its originator
would never have given countenance.</p>

<p>The pieces of furniture usually associated with him
are massive structures of ebony with their surfaces
covered with tortoiseshell, in which are inlaid
arabesques, scrolls, and foliage in thin brass or other
metal. Upon the surface of this metal inlay further
ornamentation was chased with the burin. This
alternation of tortoiseshell and brass forms a brilliant
marquetry. Into the chased designs on the metal a
black enamel was introduced to heighten the effect,
which was further increased by portions of the wood
beneath the semi-transparent tortoiseshell being
coloured black or brown or red; sometimes a bluish-green
was used. Later imitators, not content with the
beautiful effect of tortoiseshell, used horn in parts,
which is more transparent, and they did not fear the
garish effect of blue or vermilion underneath. Boule's
creations, set in massive mounts and adornments of
masks and bas-reliefs, cast in gilt-bronze and chased,
were pieces of furniture of unsurpassed magnificence,
and especially designed for the mirrored splendours
of the <i>salons</i> of Versailles.</p>

<p>In boule-work all parts of the marquetry are held
down by glue to the bed, usually of oak, the metal
being occasionally fastened down by small brass
pins, which are hammered flat and chased over so
as to be imperceptible.</p>

<p>In order to economise the material, Boule, when
his marquetry became in demand, employed a process
which led to the use of the technical terms, <i>boule</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
<i>counter-boule</i>. The brass and the tortoiseshell were
cut into thin sheets. A number of sheets of brass
were clamped together with the same number of
sheets of tortoiseshell. The design was then cut out,
the result being that each sheet of tortoiseshell had a
design cut out of it, into which the same design from
one of the sheets of brass would exactly fit. Similarly
each sheet of brass had a design cut out of it into
which a corresponding piece of tortoiseshell would fit.
That in which the ground is of tortoiseshell and the
inlaid portion is brass, is considered the better, and is
called <i>boule</i>, or the <i>première partie</i>. That in which
the groundwork is brass and the design inlaid is of
tortoiseshell, is called <i>counter-boule</i> or <i>contre-partie</i>.
This latter is used for side panels.</p>

<p>An examination of the specimens preserved in the
Louvre, at the Jones Bequest at the Victoria and
Albert Museum, or in the Wallace Collection will
enable the student to see more readily how this
practice works out in the finished result. In the
illustration (p. <a href="#Page_163">163</a>) of the two pedestals the effect of
the employment of <i>boule</i> and <i>counter-boule</i> is shown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span></p>

<p>Associated with Boule is Jean Bérain, who had a
fondness for the Italian style; his designs are more
symmetrically correct, both in ornamental detail and
in architectural proportion. His conceptions are
remarkable for their fanciful elaboration, and their
wealth of profuse scrollwork. In the French national
collections at the Louvre, at Versailles, and elsewhere
there are many beautiful examples of his chandeliers
of magnificent carved and gilded work. The freedom
of the spiral arms and complex coils he introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
into his candelabra have never been equalled as
harmonious portions of a grandly conceived scheme of
magnificent interior decoration, to which, in the days
of Louis XIV., so much artistic talent was devoted.</p>

<p>With regard to the value of some of the specimens
in the national collections, it is difficult to form an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
estimate. The Boule cabinet, probably designed by
Bérain, executed by Boule for Louis XIV. (illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_165">165</a>) would, if put up for sale at Christie's, probably
fetch £15,000. This piece is held to be grander in
style than any in the galleries in France. At the
Wallace Collection there are examples which would
bring fabulous sums if sold. A cabinet by Boule,
in the Jones Bequest, purchased by Mr. Jones for
£3,000 in 1881, is now worth three times that sum.</p>

<p>Upon the building, decorating, and furnishing of
Versailles Louis XIV. spent over five hundred million
francs, in addition to which there was the army of
workmen liable to statute labour. Some twenty
thousand men and six thousand horses were employed
in 1684 at the different parts of the château
and park. In May, 1685, there were no less than
thirty-six thousand employed.</p>

<p>The illustrious craftsmen who were employed upon
the magnificent artistic interior decorations have
transmitted their names to posterity. Bérain,
Lepautre, Henri de Gissey, are the best known of
the designers. Among the painters are the names of
Audran, Baptiste, Jouvenet, Mignard, and the best
known of the sculptors are Coustou and Van Clève.
Of the woodcarvers, metal-chasers, locksmiths, and
gilders Pierre Taupin, Ambroise Duval, Delobel, and
Goy are names of specialists in their own craft who
transformed Versailles from a royal hunting-box into
one of the most splendid palaces in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span></p>

<p>Louis XIV. died in the year following the death of
Queen Anne, so that it will be readily seen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
English art was uninfluenced by France in the days
of William and Mary, and how insular it had become
under Anne. The English craftsman was not fired
by new impulses from France during such an outburst
of decorative splendour. The reign of Louis XV.
extends from George I. down to the eleventh year of
the reign of George III., which year saw the cargoes
of tea flung into Boston harbour and the beginning
of the war with America.</p>

<p>In glancing at the Louis Quinze style it will be
observed how readily it departed from the studied
magnificence of Louis XIV. In attempting elegance
of construction and the elimination of much that was
massive and cumbersome in the former style, it
developed in its later days into meaningless ornament
and trivial construction. At first it possessed considerable
grace, but towards the end of the reign the
designs ran riot in rococo details, displaying incongruous
decoration.</p>

<p>It was the age of the elegant boudoir, and the
bedroom became a place for more intimate guests
than those received in the large reception-room. In
the days of Louis XIV. the bed was a massive
structure, but in the succeeding reign it became an
elegant appendage to a room. At Versailles the
splendid galleries of magnificent proportion were
transformed by the Duke of Orleans, Regent of
France (1715-1723) during the king's minority, into
smaller <i>salons</i> covered in wainscoting, painted white
and ornamented with gilded statues. In like manner
the Louis Quinze decorations were ruthlessly destroyed
by Louis-Philippe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span></p>

<p>The commode in the Wallace Collection (illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_171">171</a>) is of the time when Louis XV. was in his
minority, and of the days of the Regency. It is by
Charles Cressent (1685-1768), who was cabinetmaker
to Philippe d'Orleans, Regent of France. This is an
especially typical specimen of the class to which it
belongs as showing the transition style between
Louis XIV. and the succeeding reign.</p>

<p>To establish Louis the Fifteenth's <i>petits appartements</i>
the gallery painted by Mignard was demolished,
and later, in 1752, the Ambassadors' Staircase was
destroyed, the masterpiece of the architects Levau
and Dorbay, and the marvel of Louis the Fourteenth's
Versailles.</p>

<p>It is necessary to bear these facts in mind in order
to see how a new French monarch set ruthlessly new
fashions in furniture and created a taste for his
personal style in art. In the first part of the Louis
Quinze period the metal mountings by Caffieri and
Cressent are of exquisite style; they are always of
excellent workmanship, but later they betrayed the
tendency of the time for fantastic curves, which had
affected the furniture to such an extent that no
straight lines were employed, and the sides of commodes
and other pieces were swelled into unwieldy
proportions, and instead of symmetrical and harmonious
results the florid style, known as the
"rococo," choked all that was beautiful in design.
Meissonier, Director of the Royal Factories (1723-1774),
was mainly responsible for this unnatural
development. He revelled in elaborate combinations
of shellwork and impossible foliage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span></p>

<p>In the Louis XV. commodes illustrated (pp. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>, <a href="#Page_175">175</a>)
it will be seen how far superior is the design and treatment
of the one which was formerly in the celebrated
Hamilton Collection. Its chased and gilt mounts are
harmoniously arranged, and though the ornamentation
is superbly rich, it breaks no canons of art by
overloaded detail or coarse profusion. Not so much
can be said for the other commode of the rococo
style, even though the mounts be by Caffieri and
executed in masterly manner. There is a wanton
abandonment and an offensive tone in the florid
treatment which point clearly to the decline of taste
in art.</p>

<p>The highest art of concealment was not a prominent
feature in a Court which adopted its style
from the caprices of Madame du Pompadour or the
whims of Madame du Barry. But among the finest
productions are the splendid pieces of reticent cabinetmaking
by the celebrated Jean François Oeben, who
came from Holland. His preference was for geometrical
patterns, varied only with the sparing use of
flowers, in producing his most delicate marquetry.
In the pieces by Boule and others, not in tortoiseshell
but in wood inlay, the wood was so displayed
as to exhibit in the panels the grain radiating from
the centre. Oeben did not forget this principle, and
placed his bouquets of flowers, when, on occasion, he
used them, in the centre of his panels, and filled up
the panel with geometric design.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The well-known maker, Charles Cressent (1685-1768),
used rosewood, violet, and amaranth woods in
his marquetry, and at this time many new foreign
woods were employed by the cabinetmakers in France
and Italy. In addition to woods of a natural colour,
it was the practice artificially to colour light woods,
and inlay work was attempted in which trophies of
war, musical instruments, or the shepherd's crook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
hung with ribbon, were all worked out in marquetry.
Pictures, in coloured woods, in imitation of oil paintings
on canvas, were foolishly attempted, and altogether
the art of inlay, ingenious and wonderful in its construction,
began to affect trivialities and surprising
effects most unsuited to the range of its technique.</p>

<p>In the toilet-table illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_179">179</a>), this misapplication
of inlay to reproduce pictures is seen on the
three front panels and on the middle panel above.
The chief woods employed are tulip and sycamore,
inlaid with tinted lime, holly, and cherry-woods.
The mountings of the table are chased ormolu. The
cylindrical front encloses drawers with inlaid fronts.
Beneath this is a sliding shelf, under which is a
drawer with three compartments, fitted with toilet
requisites and having inlaid lids. This specimen of
Louis Quinze work is in the Jones Collection at the
Victoria and Albert Museum. It was formerly in
the possession of Queen Marie Antoinette. It is
attributed to Oeben, though from comparison with
some of the chaster work known to have come from
his hand it would seem to be of too fanciful marquetry
for his restrained and sober style.</p>

<p>It is especially true of the furniture of this great
French period that it requires harmonious surroundings.
The slightest false touch throws everything
out of balance at once. Of this fact the inventors
were well aware. If Dutch furniture requires the
quiet, restful art of Cuyp or Van der Neer, or Metzu
or Jan Steen on the surrounding walls, the interiors
of Louis Quinze demand the works of contemporary
French genre-painters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>All things worked together to produce a harmonious
<i>ensemble</i> in this brilliant period. The royal tapestry
and Sèvres porcelain factories turned out their most
beautiful productions to decorate rooms, furniture,
and for the table. Tapestries from Beauvais, Gobelins,
and Aubusson, rich silks from the looms of Lyons,
or from Lucca, Genoa, or Venice were made for wall-hangings,
for chair-backs, for seats, and for sofas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span></p>

<p>Fragonard, Natoire, and Boucher painted lunettes
over chimney-fronts, or panels of ceilings. Of great
cabinetmakers, Riesener and David Roentgen,
princes among <i>ébénistes</i>, worked in wonderful manner
in tulip-wood, in holly, in rosewood, purple wood, and
laburnum to produce marquetry, the like of which
has never been seen before nor since.</p>

<p>Associated with the period of Louis XV. is the
love for the lacquered panel. Huygens, a Dutchman,
had achieved good results in imitations of Oriental
lacquer, which in France, under the hand of Martin,
a carriage-painter, born about 1706, rivalled the
importations from Japan. It is stated that the secret
of the fine, transparent lac polish that he used was
obtained from the missionaries who resided in Japan
before the date of the massacres and foreign expulsion
of all except the Dutch traders. Vernis-Martin,
as his varnish was termed, became in general request.
From 1744 for twenty years, Sieur Simon Etienne
Martin was granted a monopoly to manufacture this
lacquered work in the Oriental style. Although he
declared that his secret would die with him, other
members of his family continued the style, which was
taken up by many imitators in the next reign. His
varnish had a peculiar limpid transparency, and he
obtained the wavy network of gold groundwork so
successfully produced by Japanese and Chinese
craftsmen. On this were delicately painted, by
Boucher and other artists, Arcadian subjects, framed
in rocaille style with gold thickly laid on, and so
pure that in the bronze gilding and in the woodwork
it maintains its fine lustre to the present day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the close of the reign of Louis XV. a
new style set in, which reverted to simpler tastes, to
which the name "<i>À la reine</i>" was given, in deference
to the taste which is supposed to have emanated from
Marie Leczinska, the queen, but is said to have been
due to Madame du Pompadour.</p>

<p>At the Wallace Collection is a fine secrétaire, with
the mounts and ornaments of gilt bronze cast and
chased, which is illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>). The central
panel of marquetry shows, in life size, a cock, with
the caduceus, a snake, a banner, and symbolical instruments.
It is by Jean François Riesener, and in
his earliest manner, made in the later years of Louis
Quinze in the Transitional style approaching the
Louis Seize period.</p>

<p>Among the wonderful creations of Riesener, probably
his masterpiece is the celebrated "Bureau du
Roi," begun in 1760 by Oeben, and completed in
1769 by Riesener&mdash;who married the widow of Oeben,
by the way. Its bronzes are by Duplesis, Winant, and
Hervieux. The design and details show the transition
between the Louis Quinze and the Louis Seize styles.</p>

<p>The original, which is at the Louvre, is in marquetry
of various coloured woods and adorned by plaques
of gilt bronze, cast and chased. The copy from
which our illustration is taken (p. <a href="#Page_183">183</a>) is in the
Wallace Collection, and is by Dasson, and follows the
original in proportions, design, and technique.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span></p>

<p>The so-called Louis Seize period embraces much
that is good from the later days of the previous reign.
The same designers were employed with the addition
of a few younger men. Caffieri and Riesener were
producing excellent work, and above all was Gouthière,
whose renown as a founder and chaser of gilded
bronze ornaments is unrivalled. Elegance and simplicity
are again the prevailing notes. Straight lines
took the place of the twisted contortions of the
rococo style. Thin scrolls, garlands, ribbons and
knots, classical cameo-shaped panels, and Sèvres
plaques form the characteristic ornamentation.</p>

<p>The acanthus-leaf, distorted into unnatural proportions
in the middle Louis Quinze period, returned
to its normal shape, the egg-and-tongue moulding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
came into use, and the delicacy of the laurel-leaf was
employed in design in Louis Seize decorations.</p>

<p>In the jewel cabinet illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_193">193</a>), the new
style is shown at its best. The cabinet is inlaid in
rosewood and sycamore, and bears the name of
"J. H. Riesener" stamped on it. The chased ormolu
mounts are by Gouthière. The geometrical inlay is
a tradition which Oeben left to his successors. The
upper portion has a rising lid with internal trays. In
the lower part is a drawer and a shelf. This piece is
at the Victoria and Albert Museum in the Jones
Bequest, and it is well worth detailed examination as
being a representative specimen of the most artistic
work produced at this period.</p>

<p>Pierre Gouthière had a complete mastery over his
technique. The estimation with which his work is
regarded has made furniture which he mounted bring
extraordinary prices. In 1882, at the dispersal of the
celebrated Hamilton Palace Collection, three specimens
with his workmanship realised £30,000.</p>

<p>The Vernis-Martin panels were decorated by
Watteau and Pater. The age of artificialities with
its <i>fêtes-galantes</i> in the royal gardens of the Luxembourg
and in the pleasure parks of the Court, with
the ill-starred Marie Antoinette playing at shepherds
and shepherdesses, had its influence upon art.
Watteau employed his brush to daintily paint the
attitudes of <i>Le Lorgneur</i> upon a fan-mount, or to
depict elegantly dressed noblemen and ladies of the
Court dancing elaborate minuets in satin shoes, or
feasting from exquisite Sèvres porcelain dishes in the
damp corner of some park or old château.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span></p>

<p>The artificial pretence at Arcadian simplicity
adopted by the Queen, in the intervals between her
attendance at public <i>bals-masqué</i>, when she almost
wantonly outraged the susceptibilities of the French
people by her frivolities, found a more permanent
form in interior decorations. Riesener and David
designed a great deal of furniture for her. Dainty
work-tables and writing-tables and other furniture of
an elegant description are preserved in the national
collection in the Louvre and at Fontainebleau, in the
Victoria and Albert Museum in the Jones Bequest,
and in the Wallace Collection. Tables of this nature
are most eagerly sought after. A small table with
plaques of porcelain in the side panels, which is said
to have belonged to Marie Antoinette, was sold at
Christie's for £6,000 (Hamilton Collection). There
is a similar writing-table in the Jones Collection,
given by Marie Antoinette to Mrs. Eden, afterwards
Lady Auckland.</p>

<p>During the period under Louis Seize, when
Fragonard and Natoire deftly painted the panels
of rooms and filled ceilings with flying cupids
and chains of roses, when Boucher was Director
of the Academy, the interior of rooms assumed a
boudoir-like appearance. The walls were decorated
in a scheme of colour. Handsome fluted pillars
with fine classic feeling were the framework of
panelling painted in delicate and subdued tones.
Oval mirrors, avoiding all massive construction,
lightened the effect, and mantelpieces of white
marble, and furniture evidently designed for use,
completed the interiors of the homes of the <i>grands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
seigneurs</i>. Sometimes the walls were painted, giving
a lustrous appearance resembling silk, and this style
is the forerunner of the modern abomination known
as wall-paper.</p>

<p>Before leaving this period of French furniture,
when so much marquetry work was done of unsurpassed
beauty and of unrivalled technique, a word
may be said as to the number of woods used. Oeben
and Riesener and their contemporaries used many
foreign woods, of which the names are unfamiliar.
Mr. Pollen, in his "South Kensington Museum
Handbook to Furniture and Woodwork," has given
the names of some of them, which are interesting as
showing the number of woods especially selected for
this artistic cabinetmaking. Tulip-wood is the
variety known as <i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>. Rosewood
was extensively used, and holly (<i>ilex aquifolium</i>), maple
(<i>acer campestre</i>), laburnum (<i>cytisus Alpinus</i>), and
purple wood (<i>copaifera pubiflora</i>). Snake-wood was
frequently used, and other kinds of light-brown wood
in which the natural grain is waved or curled,
presenting a pleasant appearance, and obviating the
use of marquetry (<i>see</i> "Woods used," p. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>).</p>

<p>In the great collections to which reference has been
made, in well-known pieces made by Riesener his
name is found stamped on the panel itself, or sometimes
on the oak lining. The large bureau in the
Wallace Collection (Gallery xvi., No. 66) is both signed
and dated "20th February, 1769." This piece, it is
said, was ordered by Stanislas Leczinski, King of
Poland, and was once one of the possessions of
the Crown of France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the cost of pieces of furniture
by the great master <i>ébénistes</i>, it is on record that
a secrétaire which was exhibited at Gore House
in 1853, and made originally for Beaumarchais by
Riesener, cost 85,000 francs, a sum not much
less than £4,000. Celebrated copies have been
made from these old models. The famous cabinet
with mounts by Gouthière, now in the possession
of the King, was copied about twenty-five years
ago for the Marquis of Hertford, by permission
of Queen Victoria. The piece took years to complete,
and it is interesting to have the evidence of its
copyists that the most difficult parts to imitate were
the metal mounts. This replica cost some £3,000,
and is now in the Wallace Collection. The copy
of the famous bureau or escritoire in the Louvre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
known as the "Bureau de St. Cloud," was made by
permission of the Emperor Napoleon III., and cost
£2,000. Another copy of the same piece exhibited
at the French International Exhibition was sold for
£3,500 to an English peeress. Many fine copies of
Riesener's work exist, and in the illustration (p. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>)
a copy is given of a handsome commode, which
exhibits his best style under the influence of his
master, Oeben.</p>

<p>When Louis XVI. called together the States-General
in 1789, which had not met since 1614,
the first stone was laid of the French Republic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
After the king was beheaded in 1793, the Reign
of Terror followed, during which the wildest licence
prevailed. Under the Directory, for four years from
1795, the country settled down until the rise of
Napoleon Bonaparte, who took the government in
his own hands with the title of Consul, and in 1804
called himself Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>During the Reign of Terror the ruthless fury of a
nation under mob-law did not spare the most
beautiful objects of art which were associated with
a hated aristocracy. Furniture especially suffered,
and it is a matter for wonderment that so much
escaped destruction. Most of the furniture of the
royal palaces was consigned to the spoliation of
"the Black Committee," who trafficked in works of
great price, and sold to foreign dealers the gems
of French art for less than a quarter of their real
value. So wanton had become the destruction of
magnificent furniture that the Convention, with an
eye on the possibilities of raising money in the
future, ordered the furniture to be safely stored
in the museums of Paris.</p>

<p>After so great a social upheaval, art in her turn
was subjected to revolutionary notions. Men cast
about to find something new. Art, more than ever,
attempted to absorb the old classic spirit. The
Revolution was the deathblow to Rococo ornament.
With the classic influences came ideas from Egypt,
and the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii
provided a further source of design. A detail of a
portion of a tripod table found at Pompeii shows
the nature of the beautiful furniture discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span></p>

<p>As early as 1763, Grimm wrote: "For some years
past we are beginning to inquire for antique ornaments
and forms. The interior and exterior decorations
of houses, furniture, materials of dress, work
of the goldsmiths, all bear alike the stamp of the
Greeks. The fashion passes from
architecture to millinery; our
ladies have their hair dressed <i>à la
Grecque</i>." A French translation
of Winckelmann appeared in 1765,
and Diderot lent his powerful aid
in heralding the dawn of the
revival of the antique long before
the curtain went up on the events
of 1789.</p>

<p>Paris in Revolution days assumed
the atmosphere of ancient Rome.
Children were given Greek and
Roman names. Classical things
got rather mixed. People called
themselves "Romans." Others had
Athenian notions. Madame Vigée-Lebrun
gave <i>soupers à la Grecque</i>.
Madame Lebrun was Aspasia, and
M. l'Abbé Barthélemy, in a Greek
dress with a laurel wreath on his
head, recited a Greek poem.</p>

<p>These, among a thousand other signs of the
extraordinary spirit of classicism which possessed
France, show how deep rooted had become the
idea of a modern Republic that should emulate
the fame of Athens and of Rome. The First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
Consul favoured these ideas, and his portraits represent
him with a laurel wreath around his head

<p>In transition days before the style known as
Empire had become fixed there is exhibited in art
a feeling which suggests the deliberate search after
new forms and new ideas. To this period belongs
the <i>servante</i>, which, by the kindness of Dr. Sigerson,
of Dublin, is reproduced from his collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
The claw-foot, the ram's head, the bay-leaf, and a
frequent use of caryatides and animal forms, is a
common ornamentation in furniture of the Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
period. In this specimen the two legs of ormolu
have these characteristics, and it is noticeable that
the shape of the leg and its details of ornament bear
a striking resemblance to the leg of the Pompeiian
table illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>). But the deities of Egypt
have contributed a new feature in the seated figure of
the goddess Isis.</p>

</div>

<p>Napoleon himself encouraged the classic spirit
which killed all memories of an <i>ancien régime</i>. He
would have been pleased to see all the relics of the
former glories of France demolished. He had at
one time a project to rebuild Versailles as a classic
temple.</p>

<p>At the height of his splendour he became the
patron of the fine arts, and attempted to leave
his impression upon art as he did upon everything
else. New furniture was designed for the Imperial
palaces. Riesener was alive, but it does not appear
that he took any part in the new creations. David,
the great French painter, an ardent Republican,
was won over to become a Court painter. At
Malmaison and at Fontainebleau there are many fine
examples of the First Empire period which, however,
cannot be regarded as the most artistic in French
furniture. Preserved at Fontainebleau is the jewel
cabinet, made by Thomire and Odiot, at the Emperor's
orders as a wedding gift, in 1810, to the
Empress Marie Louise, in emulation of the celebrated
Riesener cabinet at the Trianon. The wood used for
this, and for most of the Empire cabinets, is rich
mahogany, which affords a splendid ground for the
bronze gilt mounts (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_207">207</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span></p>

<p>The portrait of Madame Récamier, by David, which
is in the Louvre, given as headpiece to this chapter,
shows the severe style of furniture in use at the zenith
of the Empire period. The couch follows classic
models, and the tall candelabrum is a suggestion
from Herculaneum models.</p>

<p>The influence that this classic revival had upon
furniture in this country is told in a subsequent
chapter. In regard to costume, the gowns of the
First Empire period have become quite fashionable
in recent years.</p>

<p>Although this style of furniture degenerated into
commonplace designs with affectedly hard outlines,
it had a considerable vogue. In addition to the
influence it had upon the brothers Adam and upon
Sheraton, it left its trace on English furniture up
till the first quarter of the nineteenth century.
The chair illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_210">210</a>) is about the year
1800 in date. There is presumptive evidence that
this chair was made in Bombay after European design.
It is of rosewood, carved in relief with honeysuckle
and floral design. The scrolled ends of the top rail
show at once its French derivation.</p>

<p>In the national collections in this country there are
very few specimens of Empire furniture. The Duke
of Wellington has some fine examples at Apsley
House, treasured relics of its historic associations
with the victor of Waterloo. The demand in France,
for furniture of the First Empire style has in all
probability denuded the open market of many fine
specimens. Owing to the fact that this country was
at war with France when the style was at its height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
the number of Empire pieces imported was very
limited, nor does First Empire furniture seem to have
greatly captivated the taste of English collectors, as
among the records of sales of furniture by public
auction very little has come under the hammer.</p>

<p>Thomas Chippendale, the master cabinetmaker of
St. Martin's Lane, has left a name which, like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
Boule, has become a trade term to mark a certain
style in furniture. With the dawn of the age of
mahogany, Chippendale produced designs that were
especially adapted to the new wood; he relied solely
upon the delicate carving for ornament, and rejected
all inlay.</p>

<p>Discovered by Sir Walter Raleigh, who brought
specimens home with him, mahogany did not come
into general use till about 1720. The material then
used by Chippendale and his school was the splendid
mahogany from the great untouched forests, producing
at that time timber the like of which, in dimension and
in quality, is now unprocurable. The cheaper "Honduras
stuff" was then unknown, and English crews
landed and cut timber from the Spanish possessions
in spite of the protests of the owners. Many a stiff
fight occurred, and many lives were lost in shipping
this stolen mahogany to England to supply the
demand for furniture. These nefarious proceedings
more than once threatened to bring about war
between England and Spain.</p>

<p>The furniture of France, during the four great
periods treated in the previous chapters, was designed
for the use of the nobility. One wonders
what furniture was in common use by the peasantry
in France. In England, too, much of the furniture
left for the examination of posterity was made for
the use of the wealthy classes. In Jacobean days,
settles and chairs, especially the Yorkshire and
Derbyshire types, were in more common use, and
the homely pieces of Queen Anne suggest less
luxurious surroundings, but it was left for Chippendale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
to impress his taste upon all classes. In the
title-page of his great work, the <i>Director</i>, published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
in 1754, he says that his designs are "calculated to
improve and refine the present taste, and suited to
the fancy and circumstances of persons in all degrees
of life."</p>

Dr. Hawes.<br />
<br />
(<i>Bethnal Green Museum.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>His book of designs, as may naturally be supposed,
was not greatly bought by the working classes, but
fifteen copies of the <i>Director</i> went to Yorkshire, and
many other copies were subscribed for in other parts
of the country, so that local cabinetmakers began at
once to fashion their furniture after his styles.</p>

<p>The common form of chair at the time was similar
to the specimen illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>), which formerly
belonged to Oliver Goldsmith, and was bequeathed
by him to his friend, Dr. Hawes. This is of soft
wood, probably beech, painted green, with circular
seat, curved arms, and high back. Chippendale
revolutionised this inartistic style, and for the first
time in the history of the manufacture of furniture
in England, continental makers turned their eyes to
this country in admiration of the style in vogue here,
and in search of new designs.</p>

<p>It might appear, on a hasty glance at some of
Chippendale's work, that originality was not his
strong point. His claw-and-ball feet were not his
own, and he borrowed them and the wide, spacious
seats of his chairs from the Dutch, or from earlier
English furniture under Dutch influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Chambers, the architect of Somerset
House, whose fondness for Chinese ornament produced
quite a craze, and who built the Pagoda
in Kew Gardens, gave Chippendale another source
of inspiration. In his later days he came under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>
influence of the Gothic revival and was tempted to
misuse Gothic ornament.</p>

<p>His second style shows the Louis XIV. French
decoration in subjection. In his ribbon-back chairs
he employed the Louis XVI. ornamentation.</p>

<p>But Chippendale was the most masterly adapter
that England has ever produced. His adaptions
became original under his hand, and his creations
are sturdy and robust, tempered by French subtleties,
and having, here and there, as in the fretwork in the
chair-legs and angles, a suggestion of the East. He
is the prince of chair-makers. His chairs are never
unsymmetrical. He knew the exact proportion of
ornament that the structure would gracefully bear.
The splats in the chairs he made himself are of such
accurate dimensions in relation to the open spaces on
each side that this touch alone betrays the hand of
the master, which is absent in the imitations of his
followers.</p>

<p>The illustration given of the Chippendale table in
Chinese style (p. <a href="#Page_213">213</a>), is a beautiful and perfect piece
of a type rarely met with. It was made by Chippendale
for the great-grandmother of the present owner.
A similar table was in the possession of the Princess
Josephine. In chairs, the back was sometimes of
fret-cut work, as was also the design of the legs, with
fretwork in the angles, which betray his fondness
for the Chinese models. The Gothic style influenced
Chippendale only to a slight degree. Horace Walpole
at Strawberry Hill set the fashion in England,
which fortunately was short-lived.</p>

<p>Collectors divide Chippendale's work into three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
periods. To the first they assign the more solid
chairs or settees with cabriole legs and Louis XIV.
ornament, harmoniously blended with Queen Anne
style. These chairs and settees are often found with
claw-and-ball feet, and are frequently of walnut.
Two fine examples of settees, the one of oak, the
other of walnut, are illustrated.</p>

</div>

<p>The second
period embraces
the fine creations
which have the
celebrated Louis
XVI. ribbon ornamentation
in the
backs. From one
of the designs
in Chippendale's
book, here illustrated,
the elegance
of the style
is shown. It is
exuberant enough,
but the author
complains in his
volume that "In executing many of these drawings,
my pencil has but faintly carved out those images
my fancy suggested; but in this failure I console
myself by reflecting that the greatest masters of every
art have laboured under the same difficulties." The
ribbon-backed chair illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_223">223</a>) is one of the
two given to an ancestor of the present owner by the
fourth Duke of Marlborough in 1790. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
formerly at Blenheim, and there is an added interest
in them owing to the fact that the seats were worked
by Sarah, the great Duchess of Marlborough.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span></p>

<p>The latest style of Chippendale's work is the
Gothic. There are many pieces in existence which
he probably had to produce to satisfy the taste of
his fashionable clients, but the style is atrocious, and
the less said about them the better. The illustration
(p. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>) of a chair-back from his design-book shows
how offensive it could be.</p>

<p>Although his chairs
are sought after as especially
beautiful in
design (his father was
a maker of chairs before
him) he made
many other objects of
furniture. The mirrors
he designed are exquisite
examples of
fine woodcarving. The
one illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_229">229</a>)
shows the mastery he
had over graceful outline.
Bureau bookcases with drop-down fronts have
been successfully produced since his day after his
models. The one illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_231">231</a>) shows a secret
drawer, which is reached by removing the left-hand
panel. Card-tables, settees, knife-boxes, tea-caddies,
sideboards, and overmantles were made by him,
which show by their diversity of technique that there
was more than one pair of hands at work in carrying
out his designs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span></p>

<p>The collecting of Chippendale furniture has become
so fashionable of late years that genuine old pieces
are difficult to procure. It is true that two old chairs
were discovered in a workhouse last year, but when
specimens come into the market they usually bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
large prices. Two elbow state-chairs, with openwork
backs, were sold a little while ago for seven
hundred and eighty guineas, and a set of six small
chairs brought ninety-three guineas about the same
time. But even this is not the top price reached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
for two chairs at Christie's realised eleven hundred
pounds!</p>

<p>Chippendale, the shopkeeper, of St Martin's Lane,
who took orders for furniture, which he or his sons, or
workmen under their direct supervision, executed, was
one person, and Chippendale, who had quarrelled with
the Society of Upholsterers, and published a book
of designs on his own account, which quickly ran
through three editions, was another person. In the
one case he was a furniture maker whose pieces
bring enormous prices. In the other he was the
pioneer of popular taste and high-priest to the
cabinetmakers scattered up and down England,
who quickly realised the possibilities of his style,
and rapidly produced good work on his lines.</p>

<p>These pieces are by unknown men, and no doubt
much of their work has been accredited to Chippendale
himself. The illustration (p. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>) shows a
mahogany chair well constructed, of a time contemporary
with Chippendale and made by some
smaller maker. This type of chair has been copied
over and over again till it has become a recognised
pattern. It finds its counterpart in china in the old
willow-pattern, which originated at Coalport and has
been adopted as a stock design.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span></p>

<p>Furniture is not like silver, where the mark of the
maker was almost as obligatory as the hall mark.
Artists, both great and small, have signed their
pictures, and in the glorious days of the great French
<i>ébénistes</i> and metal-chasers, signed work is frequently
found. But in England, at a time when furniture of
excellent design, of original conception, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
thoroughly good workmanship was produced in
great quantities, the only surviving names are those
of designers or cabinetmakers who have published
books.</p>

<p>So great was the influence of the style of Chippendale
that it permeated all classes of society. An
interesting engraving by Stothard (p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>) shows the
interior of a room, and is dated 1782, the year that
Rodney gained a splendid victory over the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>

<p>Kitchen furniture or cottage furniture was made on
the same lines by makers all over the country. The
wood used was not mahogany; it was most frequently
beech. Chairs of this make are not museum examples,
but they are not devoid of a strong artistic feeling,
and are especially English in character. More often
than not the soft wood of this class of chair is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
to be badly worm-eaten. Two chairs of this type, of
beech, are illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_233">233</a>), and it is interesting to
note that, as in the instance of the Yorkshire and
Derbyshire chairs of Jacobean days made by local
makers, it is not common to find many of exactly
the same design. The craftsman gave a personal
character to his handiwork, which makes such
pieces of original and artistic interest, and cabinetmaking
and joinery was not then so machine-made
as it is now.</p>

<p>It may be here remarked that the earlier pieces of
the eighteenth century were polished much in the
same manner as was old oak previously described.
Highly polished surfaces and veneers, and that
abomination "French polish," which is a cheap
and nasty method of disguising poor wood, bring
furniture within the early nineteenth-century days,
when a wave of Philistine banalities swept over
Europe.</p>

<p>In the popular conception of the furniture of the
three Georges the honours are divided between
Chippendale and Sheraton. Up till recently all
that was not Chippendale was Sheraton, and all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
was not Sheraton must be Chippendale. The one
is represented by the straight-legged mahogany chairs
or cabriole legs with claw-and-ball feet and the backs
elaborately carved; the other with finely tapered legs,
built on elegant lines, and of satinwood, having
marquetry decoration or painted panels.</p>

<p>This is the rough generalisation that obtained in
the earlier days of the craze for collecting eighteenth-century
furniture. Heppelwhite and Adam (more
often than not alluded to as Adams), are now added
to the list, and auction catalogues attempt to differentiate
accordingly. But these four names do not
represent a quarter of the well-known makers who
were producing good furniture in the days between
the South Sea Bubble in 1720 and the battle of
Waterloo in 1815.</p>

<p>In this chapter it will be impossible to give more
than a passing allusion to the less-known makers
of the eighteenth century, but to those who wish to
pursue the matter in more detailed manner the
Bibliography annexed (p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>) gives ample material
for a closer study of the period.</p>

<p>The four brothers Adam, sons of a well-known
Scottish architect, were exponents of the classic style.
Robert Adam was the architect of the fine houses
in the Adelphi, and he designed the screen and
gateway at the entrance to the Admiralty in 1758.
James is credited with the designing of interior
decorations and furniture. Carriages, sedan-chairs,
and even plate were amongst the artistic objects
to which these brothers gave their stamp. The
classical capitals, mouldings and niches, the shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
flutings and the light garlands in the Adam style, are
welcome sights in many otherwise dreary streets in
London. Robert, the eldest brother, lived from 1728
to 1792, and during that time exercised a great
influence on English art.</p>

<p>In 1790, a set of designs of English furniture were
published by A. Heppelwhite. In these chairs with
pierced backs, bookcases with fancifully framed glass
doors, and mahogany bureaux, the influence of Chippendale
is evident, but the robustness of the master
and the individuality of his style become transformed
into a lighter and more elegant fashion, to
which French <i>finesse</i> and the Adam spirit have
contributed their influence.</p>

<p>In the illustration (p. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>) various types of chairs
of the period are given. A chair termed the
"ladder-back" was in use in France at the same
time. In Chardin's celebrated picture of "<i>Le jeu de
l'oye</i>," showing the interior of a parlour of the middle
eighteenth century, a chair of this type is shown.</p>

<p>The Heppelwhite settee illustrated as the headpiece
to this chapter shows the delicate fluting in the
woodwork, and the elaborated turned legs which
were beginning to be fashionable at the close
of the eighteenth century. The two chairs by
Heppelwhite &amp; Co., illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>), are typical
examples of the elegance of the style which has an
individuality of its own&mdash;a fact that collectors are
beginning to recognise.</p>

<p>The shield-back chair with wheat-ear and openwork
decoration, and legs in which the lathe has
been freely used, are characteristic types. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
elegance of the legs in Heppelwhite chairs is
especially noticeable. The designers departed from
Chippendale with results exquisitely symmetrical,
and of most graceful ornamentation.</p>

<p>Hogarth, in his biting satires on the absurdities of
Kent, the architect, painter, sculptor, and ornamental
gardener, whose claims to be any one of the four
rest on slender foundations, did not prevent fashionable
ladies consulting him for designs for furniture,
picture frames, chairs, tables, for cradles, for silver
plate, and even for the construction of a barge.
It is recorded by Walpole that two great ladies
who implored him to design birthday gowns for
them were decked out in incongruous devices: "the
one he dressed in a petticoat decorated in columns of
the five orders, and the other like a bronze, in a
copper-coloured satin, with ornaments of gold."</p>

<p>Heppelwhite learned the lesson of Hogarth, that
"the line of beauty is a curve," and straight lines
were studiously avoided in his designs. Of the
varieties of chairs that he made, many have the
Prince of Wales's feathers either carved upon them
in the centre of the open-work back or japanned
upon the splat, a method of decoration largely
employed in France, which has not always stood the
test of time, for when examples are found they often
want restoration. Of satin-wood, with paintings
upon the panels, Heppelwhite produced some good
examples, and when he attempted greater elaboration
his style in pieces of involved design and intricacy of
detail became less original, and came into contact
with Sheraton. His painted furniture commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
high prices, and the name of Heppelwhite will stand
as high as Chippendale or Sheraton for graceful
interpretations of the spirit which invested the
late eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Before dealing with Sheraton in detail, the names
of some lesser known makers contemporary with him
may be mentioned. Matthias Lock, together with
a cabinetmaker named Copeland, published in 1752
designs of furniture which derived their inspiration
from the brothers Adam, which classic feeling later,
in conjunction with the Egyptian and Pompeian
spirit, dominated the style of the First Empire.
Josiah Wedgewood, with his Etruscan vases, and
Flaxman, his designer, filled with the new classic
spirit, are examples in the world of pottery of
the influences which were transmitted through the
French Revolution to all forms of art when men
cast about in every direction to find new ideas
for design.</p>

<p>Ince and Mayhew, two other furniture designers,
published a book in 1770, and Johnson outdid
Chippendale's florid styles in a series of designs he
brought out, which, with their twisted abortions, look
almost like a parody of Thomas Chippendale's worst
features. There is a "Chairmaker's Guide," by
Manwaring and others in 1766, which contains
designs mainly adapted from all that was being
produced at the time. It is not easy to tell the
difference between chairs made by Manwaring and
those made by Chippendale, as he certainly stands
next to the great master in producing types which
have outlived ephemeral tastes, and taken their
stand as fine artistic creations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span></p>

<p>Among other names are those of Shearer, Darly,
and Gillow, all of whom were notable designers and
makers of furniture in the period immediately preceding
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Thomas Sheraton, contemporary with William
Blake the dreamer, shares with him the unfortunate
posthumous honour of reaching sensational prices in
auction rooms. There is much in common between
the two men. Sheraton was born in 1751 at Stockton-on-Tees,
and came to London to starve. Baptist
preacher, cabinetmaker, author, teacher of drawing,
he passed his life in poverty, and died in distressed
circumstances. He was, before he brought out his
book of designs, the author of several religious works.
Often without capital to pursue his cabinetmaking
he fell back on his aptitude for drawing, and gave
lessons in design. He paid young Black, who
afterwards became Lord Provost of Edinburgh, half
a guinea a week as workman in his cabinetmaker's
shop in Soho. In a pathetic picture of those days
the Lord Provost, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, tells how Sheraton
and his wife and child had only two cups and saucers
and the child had a mug, and when the writer took
tea with them the wife's cup and saucer were given
up to the guest, and she drank her tea from a
common mug. This reads like Blake's struggles
when he had not money enough to procure copper-plates
on which to engrave his wonderful visions.</p>

<p>That the styles of Chippendale and Sheraton
represent two distinct schools is borne out by what
Sheraton himself thought of his great predecessor.
Speaking in his own book of Chippendale's previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
work he says: "As for the designs themselves they
are wholly antiquated, and laid aside, though possessed
of great merit according to the times in which they
were executed." From this it would appear that the
Chippendale style, at the time of Sheraton's "Cabinetmaker's
and Upholsterer's Drawing Book," published
in 1793, had gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>The woods mostly employed by Sheraton were
satinwood, tulip-wood, rosewood, and apple-wood,
and occasionally mahogany. In place of carved
scrollwork he used marquetry, and on the cabinets
and larger pieces panels were painted by Cipriani
and Angelica Kauffman. There is a fine example
of the latter's work in the Victoria and Albert
Museum.</p>

<p>Sheraton borrowed largely from the French style
under Louis XVI., when the lines had become
severer; he came, too, under the influence of the
Adam designs. He commonly used turned legs, and
often turned backs, in his chairs. His later examples
had a hollowed or spoon back to fit the body of the
sitter. When he used mahogany he realised the
beauty of effect the dark wood would give to inlay
of lighter coloured woods, or even of brass. The
splats and balusters, and even the legs of some of
his chairs, are inlaid with delicate marquetry work.</p>

<p>Ornament for its own sake was scrupulously
eschewed by Sheraton. The essential supports and
uprights and stretcher-rails and other component
parts of a piece of furniture were only decorated as
portions of a preconceived whole. The legs were
tapered, the plain surfaces were inlaid with marquetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
but nothing meaningless was added. In France
Sheraton's style was termed "<i>Louis Seize à l'Anglaise</i>."</p>

<p>It was the firm of Heppelwhite that first introduced
the painted furniture into England, and under
Sheraton it developed into an emulation of the
fine work done by Watteau and Greuze in the days
of Marie Antoinette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span></p>

<p>Among the varied pieces that Sheraton produced
are a number of ingenious inventions in furniture,
such as the library-steps he made for George III. to
rise perpendicularly from the top of a table frame,
and when folded up to be concealed within it. His
bureau-bookcases and writing-cabinets have sliding
flaps and secret drawers and devices intended to
make them serve a number of purposes.</p>

<p>On the front of his chairs is frequently found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>

he puts to graceful use.</p>

<p>The influence of his work, and of that of Heppelwhite
&amp; Co., was lasting, and much of the late
eighteenth century and early nineteenth century
cabinetmaking owes its origin to their designs. The
old English secrétaire illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_250">250</a>), of rose
and satinwood, with drawer above and fall-down
front, having cupboard beneath with doors finely
inlaid with plaques of old lac, is of the date when
Heppelwhite was successfully introducing this class
of French work into England. It is especially
interesting to note that the drawer-handles are
mounted with old Battersea enamel.</p>

<p>The difficulty of definitely pronouncing as to the
maker of many of the pieces of furniture of the
late eighteenth century is recognised by experts.
The chair illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_251">251</a>) cannot be assigned to
any particular designer, though its genuine old
feeling is indisputable. In the fine collection of
old furniture of this period at the Victoria and
Albert Museum will be found many examples of
chairs with no other title assigned to them than
"late eighteenth century." This fact speaks for
itself. A great and growing school had followed
the precepts of Chippendale and Heppelwhite and
Sheraton. This glorious period of little more than
half a century might have been developed into a new
Renaissance in furniture. Unfortunately, the early
days of the nineteenth century and the dreary
Early Victorian period, both before and after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
great Exhibition of 1851, display the most tasteless
ineptitude in nearly every branch of art. From
the days of Elizabeth down to the last of the
Georges, English craftsmen, under various influences,
have produced domestic furniture of great beauty.
It is impossible to feel any interest in the Windsor
chair, the saddle-bag couch, or the red mahogany
cheffonière. The specimens of misapplied work
shown at the Bethnal Green Museum, relics of the
English exhibits at the first Exhibition, are unworthy
of great traditions.</p>

<p>The awakened interest shown by all classes in old
furniture will do much to carry the designers back to
the best periods in order to study the inheritance the
masters have left, and it is to be hoped that the
message of the old craftsmen dead and gone will
not fall on deaf ears.</p>

<span style="font-size: 75%;;">HINTS TO COLLECTORS</span></h2>


<p>The demand for old furniture has become so great
that there is an increasing difficulty in supplying it.
In order to satisfy the collector many artifices have
been practised which in varying degree are difficult
to detect, according to the skill and ingenuity of the
present-day manufacturer of "antique" furniture.</p>

<p>Replicas of old pieces are frequently made, and
the workmanship is so excellent, and the copy of
the old craftsman's style so perfect, that it only
requires a century or two of wear to give to the
specimen the necessary tone which genuine old
furniture has naturally acquired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span></p>

<p>In particular, French ornate furniture from the
days of Boule to the Empire period has received
the flattering attention of the fabricator by being
imitated in all its details. These high-class French
pieces are fine examples of cabinetmaking, and it is
not easy for anybody who has not a special expert
knowledge to pronounce definitely upon their authenticity.
Doubts have even been expressed regarding
certain pieces in the great national collections; in
fact the art of the forger in regard to old French
furniture, of which specimens change hands at anything
from £1,000 to £10,000, has reached a very
high level of excellence, having almost been elevated
to one of the fine arts. If a clever workman possessed
of great artistic feeling turns his attention to forging
works of art, it is obvious that his triumph is complete
over amateurs possessed of less artistic taste
and knowledge than himself.</p>

<p>Many secret processes are employed to impart an
appearance of age to the wood and to the metal
mountings. The cruder methods are to eat off the
sharper edges of the metal mountings by means of
acid, and to discolour the newer surfaces by the aid
of tobacco juice, both of which are not difficult to
detect. The steady manufacture of these finer pieces
goes on in France, and it has been found that the
foggy atmosphere of London is especially useful in
producing the effect of age upon the finer work,
consequently many forged pieces are shipped to
London to be stored in order to ripen until considered
fit for the American market, where so many
forgeries have been planted. The reward is great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
and even considering the amount of trouble bestowed
upon such pieces and the excellence of the artistic
work where the highest skilled labour is employed,
the profit is enormous. The parvenu buys his
Louis XIV. or Louis XV. suite, and pays an
immense sum for pieces which are stated to have
come from some French nobleman's château, whose
name must not be divulged, and so the interesting
deal is brought to a successful termination.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/img263.jpg" width="419" height="500" alt="&quot;MADE-UP&quot; BUFFET." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MADE-UP&quot; BUFFET.<br />
<br />
The middle portion, consisting of the two drawers and three panelled cupboards above,
is genuine old carved oak. The stand, with the finely turned legs and rails, and the
whole of the upper portion, is modern.</span>
</div>

<p>As an object-lesson as to the truth of the above
remarks, the Wallace Collection contains a modern
French copy in facsimile, by Dasson, of the celebrated
"Bureau du Roi" of the Louis XV. period, the
original being in the Louvre. The original is fully
described in the chapter on Louis XV. style, and
it is not too much to assert that ninety-nine per
cent. of the visitors to the Collection could not say
that this copy was not an old French specimen of
over a century and a quarter ago, and the remaining
one, unless he happened to be an expert, would not
question its genuineness.</p>

<p>Old oak has always been a favourite with the
public, and from the modern Flemish monstrosities,
carved in evil manner and displaying proportions in
the worst possible taste, to the equally vulgar home
production in buffet or sideboard, and stocked by
many dealers in so-called "antique" furniture, the
number of grotesque styles foisted upon the public
within the last fifteen years has been remarkable.
One wonders what has become of the high-backed
oak chairs, nearly black with repeated applications
of permanganate of potash, having flaming red-leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
seats. They seem to have mysteriously disappeared
from up-to-date "antique" stores of late. The public
has taken to inquiring into art matters a little more
closely. Nowadays the latest thing is "fumed" oak,
which is modern oak discoloured by means of
ammonia, which darkens the surface of the wood
to a depth of a sixteenth of an inch. It is not infrequent
to find an attempt made to represent this
as old oak after an elaborate treatment with linseed
oil, turpentine, and beeswax, though an examination
of the interior edges of the wood will discover its
modernity at once.</p>

<p>Of course, such tricks as these are not practised by
any firm of standing, who cannot afford to damage
their reputation by any misrepresentation. As a
general rule a dealer will readily point out the
details of workmanship and offer technical information
of much value to a beginner, if he discovers that
his customer is a collector desirous of acquiring only
fine specimens. It is more often than not the folly
of the public, and not the dishonesty of the dealer,
which results in trade frauds being committed in the
attempt to execute some impossible and imperative
order, which the moneyed collector has given. The
difference between the genuine and the replica is
most clearly made by old-fashioned firms of high
standing. It is only when the collector enters into
the arena and endeavours to set forth in quest of
bargains, where he pits his skill against that of the
dealer in the hope of outwitting the latter, that he is
obviously on dangerous ground. In the one case he
pays a higher price and obtains the benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
experience of a firm with expert knowledge, in the
other he relies on his own judgment in picking up a
bargain from some one whom he believes to be
possessed of less knowledge than himself. If he is
successful he is not slow to brag about his cleverness;
but if he is worsted in the encounter, and pays, let us
say, five pounds for an object which he fondly believed
was worth fifty, if genuine, and which he subsequently
discovers is worth less than he gave, there is nothing
too bad to say concerning his antagonist.</p>

<p>It is chiefly by the character of carved work that
old pieces can be recognised. There are three classes
of pitfalls to avoid.</p>

<p>1. Fraudulent pieces throughout, of modern wood
and of modern carving.</p>

<p>2. "Made-up" pieces which often consist of
genuine old pieces of carved wood pieced together
ingeniously from fragments of carvings, with modern
additions.</p>

<p>3. "Restored" pieces which are mainly old and
should have received, if admitted to a collection, only
the necessary repairs to make them serviceable.</p>

<p>With regard to the first class, fraudulent throughout,
it is the hope of the writer that enough has
already been written in this volume to point the
way to the reader and to assist him to follow his
natural inclinations in developing the necessary
critical taste to readily detect pieces wholly false in
character and feeling.</p>

<p>"Made-up" pieces present a greater difficulty.
Considerable skill has been exercised in combining
certain parts of old furniture into a whole which is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
however, mostly inharmonious. In pieces of this
nature there is an absence of feeling in style and
carving. It is difficult to define the exact meaning
of the word "feeling" as applied to art objects, it is
a subtle expression of skill and poetry which communicates
itself to the lover of art. It is so subtle
and elusive that experts will tell one that such and
such a piece requires to be "lived with" to test its
authenticity. Mr. Frederick Roe, whose volume on
"Ancient Coffers and Cupboards" displays a profound
knowledge of his subject, writes, "it occasionally
happens that pieces are so artfully made up that
only living with them will enable the collector to
detect the truth. In dealing with pieces of this
suspicious kind one often has to fall back on a sort
of instinct. With critical collectors of every sort
this innate sense plays a very important part."</p>

<p>Two specimens of "made-up" furniture are reproduced,
which will bear close study in order to
appreciate the difficulty of collecting old oak.</p>

<p>The illustration of the buffet (p. <a href="#Page_261">261</a>) has many
points of interest. The general appearance of the
piece is not inharmonious. It has been carefully
thought out and no less carefully put into effect.
The middle portion, consisting of the three drawers
and the three cupboards above, up to and including
the shelf partition at the top, is the only old part.
The handles, locks, and escutcheons of the two
drawers are old, but the hinges above are modern
copies of old designs, and the handles of the cupboards
are modern replicas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span></p>

OLD OAK." title="" />
<span class="caption">CABINET OF
OLD OAK.<br />
<br />
MADE UP FROM
SEVERAL PIECES
OF GENUINE
OLD CARVED OAK.</span>
</div>

<p>The massive stand with artistically turned rails in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
Jacobean style, is soft wood artfully fumed and
generously beeswaxed. The whole of the top portion
has been added and is soft wood very well
carved. The carving of the panels is also well
executed, and is evidently a copy of some old design.</p>

<p>The older portion is a fine piece of early Jacobean
work, and it is not difficult to distinguish between
the feeling of this and the expression conveyed by
the modern woodwork. The patina of the wood
after two centuries of exposure and polishing has
that peculiarly pleasing appearance which accompanies
genuine old woodwork. The edges of the
carving have lost their sharp angles, and the mellowness
of the middle panels are in strong contrast to
the harsher tone of those of the upper portion.</p>

<p>Such a piece as this would not deceive an expert,
nor, perhaps, is it intended to, or greater care would
have been bestowed upon it, but it is sufficiently
harmonious in composition not to offend in a glaring
manner, and might easily deceive a tyro.</p>

<p>The next piece illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>) is interesting
from another point of view. It is a more elaborate
attempt to produce a piece of old furniture in which
the details themselves have all the mellowness of fine
old oak. In fact, with the exception of one portion,
some eight inches by three, to which allusion will be
made later, the whole of it is genuine old oak.</p>

<p>The three panels at the top are finely carved and
are Jacobean work. The two outside panels at the
bottom, though of a later period, are good work.
The middle panel at the bottom is evidently a portion
of a larger piece of carving, because the pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
abruptly breaks off, and it was most certainly not
designed by the old carver to lie on its side in this
fashion.</p>

<p>The two heads at the top corners have been cut
from some old specimen, and artfully laid on. The
carving on both sides, running below each head from
top to bottom, is of two distinct designs joined in
each case in a line level with the upper line of the
lower panels. The two uprights on each side of
the middle lower panel are exquisite pieces of carved
work, but certainly never intended to be upright.
They are evidently portions of a long, flowing ornament,
as their cut-off appearance too plainly shows.</p>

<p>The top panels have done duty elsewhere, as part
of the ornamental carving at the top and bottom of
each lozenge is lost. The long line of scrolled
carving above them is distinctly of interest. On
the left hand, from the head to the middle of the
panel, a piece of newer carving has been inserted,
some eight inches long. The wood, at one time
darkened to correspond with the adjacent carving,
has become lighter, which is always the case when
wood is stained to match other portions. The
carving in this new portion follows in every detail
the lines of the older design, and is a very pretty
piece of "faking."</p>

<p>The cross-piece running from left to right, dividing
the lower panels from the upper, is in three parts.
An examination of the design shows that the last
three circles on the right, and the last four on the
left, are of smaller size than the others. The design
evidently belonged to some other piece of furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
and has been removed to do service in this "made-up"
production.</p>

<p>In all probability the two uprights enclosing the
top middle panel, and the two uprights on the outside
at the bottom were once portions of a carved bedstead,
as they are all of the same size and design. It
is a notorious trick to slice an old carved bedpost
into four pieces, skilfully fitting the pieces into
"made-up" furniture.</p>

<p>There is a prevalent idea that worm-holes are
actually produced in furniture, in order to give a
new piece a more realistic appearance. There are
traditions of duck-shot having been used, and there
is little doubt that holes were drilled by makers who
knew their public. But it is improbable that such
artifices would be of much use for deceptive purposes
nowadays. As a matter of fact, worm-holes are
avoided by any one who gives a moment's thought
to the matter. To get rid of worm in furniture is
no easy task, and they eventually ruin any pieces
they tenant.</p>

<p>The illustration (p. <a href="#Page_274">274</a>) shows a piece of Spanish
chestnut badly honeycombed by furniture worms.
In chairs, especially, their havoc is almost irreparable,
and in the softer woods the legs become too rotten to
be repaired or even strengthened. Metal plates are
often screwed on the sides to prevent the chairs
falling to pieces, but they become useless to sit upon
without fear of disaster.</p>

<p>The insect is really the boring wood-beetle, which
is armed with formidable forceps, to enable it to
burrow through the wood. The worm, the larva of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
this beetle, is also provided with boring apparatus,
and this insect, whether as beetle or as worm, is a
deadly enemy to all furniture. The "death-watch"
is also accused of being a depredator of books and of
furniture of soft wood.</p>

<p>To remove worms from furniture is a costly
undertaking, requiring the greatest skill. Large
pieces of furniture have actually to be taken to
pieces and the whole of the damaged parts removed
with a chisel. In cases where the legs, or slender
supports, have been attacked, the difficulty is one
requiring the specialist's most delicate attention.
Various applications are recommended, but cannot
be stated to be reliable. Injecting paraffin is said
to be the best remedy, and putting the pieces in a
chamber where all the openings have been sealed, and
lighting pans of sulphur underneath the furniture,
allowing the specimens to remain in this fumigating
bath for some days is another method resorted to.</p>

<p>With regard to Chippendale furniture, a word
of caution is necessary. It is as impossible for
Chippendale and his workmen to have produced
all the furniture attributed to them as it is for the
small factory at Lowestoft to have made all the
china with which it is credited. As has been shown
in the chapter on Thomas Chippendale, his styles
were most extensively copied by his contemporaries
all over the country and by many makers after him,
and modern makers produce a great quantity of
"Chippendale" every year. Only a careful examination
of museum pieces will train the eye of the
collector. The fine sense of proportion, at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
noticeable in the genuine Chippendale chair, is
absent in the modern copy, and, above all, the
carving in the latter is thin and poor. In the old
days the wastage of wood was not a thing which
the master had in his mind. In modern copies
the curl of the arm, or the swell at the top of the
back, shows a regard for economy. There is a
thin, flat look about the result, which ought not
to be mistaken. Scrolls and ribbon-work are often
added to later pieces made in the style of Chippendale,
which have enough wood in their surfaces to
bear carving away.</p>

<p>An ingenious device is adopted
in cases of inlaid pieces of a small
nature, such as imitation Sheraton
clock-cases and knife-boxes and
the frames of mirrors. Old engravings
are procured of scrollwork,
usually from the end of
some book. The illustration (p. <a href="#Page_259">259</a>) shows the class
of engravings selected. These engravings are coated
with a very thin layer of vellum, which is boiled down
to a liquid, and carefully spread over them. After
this treatment they are ready to be glued on to the
panels to be "faked," and, when coated over with
transparent varnish, they present the appearance of
an ivory and ebony inlay.</p>

<p>The frauds practised in satinwood and painted
pieces are many and are exceedingly difficult to
detect. Much of Sheraton's furniture was veneered
with finely selected specimens of West India satinwood.
These carefully chosen panels were painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
by Cipriani and others. The modern "faker" has
not the material to select from, as the satinwood
imported is not so beautiful nor so richly varied in
grain as in the old days. He removes a side panel
from an old piece, and substitutes another where its
obnoxious presence is not so noticeable. To this
old panel he affixes a modern coloured print after
one of Sheraton's artists, which, when carefully
varnished over and skilfully treated so as to
represent the cracks in the supposed old painting,
is ready for insertion in the "made-up" sideboard,
to catch the fancy of the unwary collector.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
